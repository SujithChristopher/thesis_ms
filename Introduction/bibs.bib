	abstract = {It was at the {IEEE} International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Pasadena in 2008 when, over a beer, we decided to write an undergraduate textbook on robotics. Since 1996, Frank had been teaching robot kinematics to Seoul National University undergraduates using his own lecture notes; by 2008 these notes had evolved to the kernel around which this book was written. Kevin had been teaching his introductory robotics class at Northwestern University from his own set of notes, with content drawn from an eclectic collection of papers and books. We believe that there is a distinct and unifying perspective to mechanics, planning, and control for robots that is lost if these subjects are studied inde- pendently, or as part of other more traditional subjects. At the 2008 meeting, we noted the lack of a textbook that (a) treated these topics in a unified way, with plenty of exercises and figures, and (b), most importantly, was written at a level appropriate for a first robotics course for undergraduates with only freshman-level physics, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and a lit- tle bit of computing background. We decided that the only sensible recourse was to write such a book ourselves. (We didn’t know then that it would take us more than eight years to finish the project!) A second motivation for this book, and one that we believe sets it apart from other introductory treatments on robotics, is its emphasis on modern geometric techniques. Often the most salient physical features of a robot are best captured by a geometric description. The advantages of the geometric approach have been recognized for quite some time by practitioners of classical screw theory. What has made these tools largely inaccessible to undergraduates—the primary tar- get audience for this book—is that they require an entirely new language of notations and constructs (screws, twists, wrenches, reciprocity, transversality, conjugacy, etc.), and their often obscure rules for manipulation and transfor- mation. On the other hand, the mostly algebraic alternatives to screw theory often mean that students end up buried in the details of calculation, losing th},

In this paper, a kinematic model with velocity compensation of the combined mobile system is created, aimed to provide a theoretical kinematic basis for accurate motion control. Motion simulations of a single four-Mecanum-wheeled virtual robot prototype on {RecurDyn} and motion tests of a robot physical prototype are carried out, and the motions of a variety of combined mobile configurations are also simulated. Motion simulation and test results prove that the kinematic models of single-and multiple-robot combination systems are correct, and the inverse kinematic correction model with velocity compensation matrix is feasible. Through simulations or experiments, the velocity compensation coefficients of the robots can be measured and the velocity compensation matrix can be created. This modified inverse kinematic model can effectively reduce the errors of robot motion caused by wheel slippage and improve the motion accuracy of the mobile robot system.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13731},
	abstract = {A fiducial marker system usually consists of markers, a detection algorithm, and a coding system. The appearance of markers and the detection robustness are generally limited by the existing detection algorithms, which are hand-crafted with traditional low-level image processing techniques. Furthermore, a sophisticatedly designed coding system is required to overcome the shortcomings of both markers and detection algorithms. To improve the flexibility and robustness in various applications, we propose a general deep learning based framework, {DeepTag}, for fiducial marker design and detection. {DeepTag} not only supports detection of a wide variety of existing marker families, but also makes it possible to design new marker families with customized local patterns. Moreover, we propose an effective procedure to synthesize training data on the fly without manual annotations. Thus, {DeepTag} can easily adapt to existing and newly-designed marker families. To validate {DeepTag} and existing methods, beside existing datasets, we further collect a new large and challenging dataset where markers are placed in different view distances and angles. Experiments show that {DeepTag} well supports different marker families and greatly outperforms the existing methods in terms of both detection robustness and pose accuracy. Both code and dataset are available at https://herohuyongtao.github.io/research/publications/deep-tag/.},

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {An important goal in rehabilitation engineering is to develop technology that allows individuals with severe motor impairment to practice arm movement without continuous supervision from a rehabilitation therapist. This paper describes the development of such a system, called Therapy {WREX} or ("T-{WREX}"). The system consists of an orthosis that assists in arm movement across a large workspace, a grip sensor that detects hand grip pressure, and software that simulates functional activities. The arm orthosis is an instrumented, adult-sized version of the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton ({WREX}), which is a five degrees-of-freedom mechanism that passively counterbalances the weight of the arm using elastic bands. After providing a detailed design description of T-{WREX}, this paper describes two pilot studies of the system's capabilities. The first study demonstrated that individuals with chronic stroke whose arm function is compromised in a normal gravity environment can perform reaching and drawing movements while using T-{WREX}. The second study demonstrated that exercising the affected arm of five people with chronic stroke with T-{WREX} over an eight week period improved unassisted movement ability (mean change in Fugl-Meyer score was 5 points plusmn2 {SD}; mean change in range of motion of reaching was 10\%, p{\textless}0.001).

	abstract = {Background/Objective. The authors previously developed a passive instrumented arm orthosis (Therapy Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton [T-{WREX}]) that enables individuals with hemiparesis to exercise the arm by playing computer games in a gravity-supported environment. The purpose of this study was to compare semiautonomous training with T-{WREX} and conventional semiautonomous exercises that used a tabletop for gravity support. Methods. Twenty-eight chronic stroke survivors with moderate/severe hemiparesis were randomly assigned to experimental (T-{WREX}) or control (tabletop exercise) treatment. A blinded rater assessed arm movement before and after twenty-four 1-hour treatment sessions and at 6-month follow-up. Subjects also rated subjective treatment preferences after a single-session crossover treatment. Results. All subjects significantly improved ( P ≤ .05) upper extremity motor control (Fugl-Meyer), active reaching range of motion ({ROM}), and self-reported quality and amount of arm use (Motor Activity Log). Improvements were sustained at 6 months. The T-{WREX} group maintained gains on the Fugl-Meyer significantly better than controls at 6 months (improvement of 3.6 ± 3.9 vs 1.5 ± 2.7 points, mean ± {SD}; P = .04). Subjects also reported a preference for T-{WREX} training. Conclusion . Gravity-supported arm exercise, using the T-{WREX} or tabletop support, can improve arm movement ability after chronic severe hemiparesis with brief one-on-one assistance from a therapist (approximately 4 minutes per session). The 3-dimensional weight support, instant visual movement feedback, and simple virtual reality software provided by T-{WREX} were associated with modest sustained gains at 6-month follow-up when compared with the conventional approach.},

	abstract = {Conroy {SS}, Whitall J, Dipietro L, Jones-Lush {LM}, Zhan M, Finley {MA}, Wittenberg {GF}, Krebs {HI}, Bever {CT}. Effect of gravity on robot-assisted motor training after chronic stroke: a randomized trial.
Objectives
To determine the efficacy of 2 distinct 6-week robot-assisted reaching programs compared with an intensive conventional arm exercise program ({ICAE}) for chronic, stroke-related upper-extremity ({UE}) impairment. To examine whether the addition of robot-assisted training out of the horizontal plane leads to improved outcomes.
Design
Randomized controlled trial, single-blinded, with 12-week follow-up.
Setting
Research setting in a large medical center.
Participants
Adults (N=62) with chronic, stroke-related arm weakness stratified by impairment severity using baseline {UE} motor assessments.
Interventions
Sixty minutes, 3 times a week for 6 weeks of robot-assisted planar reaching (gravity compensated), combined planar with vertical robot-assisted reaching, or intensive conventional arm exercise program.
Main Outcome Measure
{UE} Fugl-Meyer Assessment ({FMA}) mean change from baseline to final training.
Results
All groups showed modest gains in the {FMA} from baseline to final with no significant between group differences. Most change occurred in the planar robot group (mean change ± {SD}, 2.94±0.77; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.40–4.47). Participants with greater motor impairment (n=41) demonstrated a larger difference in response (mean change ± {SD}, 2.29±0.72; 95\% {CI}, 0.85–3.72) for planar robot-assisted exercise compared with the intensive conventional arm exercise program (mean change ± {SD}, 0.43±0.72; 95\% {CI}, –1.00 to 1.86).
Conclusions
Chronic {UE} deficits because of stroke are responsive to intensive motor task training. However, training outside the horizontal plane in a gravity present environment using a combination of vertical with planar robots was not superior to training with the planar robot alone.},

The deep-learning method achieves a high mean average precision exceeding 0.9 in the coverless test set and over 0.4 under corner coverage, whereas traditional algorithm fails under the occlusion condition. The custom lightweight network notably speeds up the prediction process with acceptable decline in performance.
