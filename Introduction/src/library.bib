   abstract = {As complex treatment techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) entail the modeling of rounded leaf-end transmission in the treatment planning system, it is important to accurately determine the dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) value for a precise calculation of dose. The advancements in the application of the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) in quality assurance (QA) and dosimetry have facilitated the determination of DLG in this study. The DLG measurements were performed using both the ionization chamber (DLG < inf > ion < /inf > ) and EPID (DLG < inf > EPID < /inf > ) for sweeping gap fields of different widths. The DLG < inf > ion < /inf >  values were found to be 1.133 mm and 1.120 mm for perpendicular and parallel orientations of the 0.125 cm < sup > 3 < /sup >  ionization chamber, while the corresponding DLG < inf > EPID < /inf >  values were 0.843 mm and 0.819 mm, respectively. It was found that the DLG was independent of volume and orientation of the ionization chamber, depth, source to surface distance (SSD), and the rate of dose delivery. Since the patient-specific QA tests showed comparable results between the IMRT plans based on the DLG < inf > EPID < /inf >  and DLG < inf > ion < /inf > , it is concluded that the EPID can be a suitable alternative in the determination of DLG.},

DIBH is highly reproducible, and this study aims to find out its dosimetric benefits over FB. Materials and Methods: Nineteen left-sided mastectomy patients were immobilized using breast boards with both arms positioned above the head. All patients had 2 sets of planning CT images (one in FB and another in DIBH) with a Bio- Darapu et al.: Is the Deep Inspiration Breath-Hold Technique Superior to the Free Breathing Technique in Cardiac and Lung Sparing while Treating both Left-Sided Post-Mastectomy Chest Wall and Supraclavicular Regions? 38 graph TruePoint HD CT scanner in the same setup. DIBH was performed by tracking the res-piratory cycles using a Varian Real-Time Position Management system. The target (chest wall and supraclavicular region), organs at risk (OARs; ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, heart, LAD, and contralateral breast), and other organs of interests were delineated as per the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) contouring guidelines. The single-isocenter con-formal fields in the field treatment plans were generated with the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (Varian Medical Systems) for both FB and DIBH images, and the doses to the target and OARs were compared. The standard fractionation regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks was used for all patients in this study. Results and Discussion: The target coverage parameters (V95, V105, V107, and D mean) were found to be 97.8 ± 0.9, 6.1 ± 3.4, 0.2 ± 0.3, and 101.9 ± 0.5% in the FB plans and 98.1 ± 0.8, 6.1 ± 3.2, 0.2 ± 0.3, and 101.9 ± 0.4% in the DIBH plans, respectively. The plan quality indices (conformity index and homogeneity index) also showed 1.3 ± 0.2 and 0.1 for the FB plans and 1.2 ± 0.3 and 0.1 for the DIBH plans, respectively. There was a significant reduction in dose to the heart in the DIBH plans compared to the FB plans, with p values of nearly 0 for the V5, V10, V25, V30, and D mean do-simetric parameters. The difference in ipsilateral lung doses between FB and DIBH showed statistically significant p values, and the differences in mean doses were found to be 7, 15.7, 11.8, and 10.7% for V5, V20, V30, and D mean , respectively. There was a significant reduction in dose to the LAD in the DIBH compared to the FB plans. Conclusions: DIBH resulted in signif-icant reductions in doses to the heart, LAD, and lungs, since with this technique there was an increase in the distance between the target and the OARs. With appropriate patient selection and adequate training, the DIBH technique is acceptable and achievable for radiotherapy to the chest, and therefore should be considered for all suitable patients, as this could result in fewer radiotherapy-related complications. However, this technique is time-consuming, since the setup is complex, results in an increased time for treatment delivery, and needs patient cooperation and technical expertise.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of using cone beam CT with extended longitudinal field-of-view (CBCTeLFOV) for image guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART). Methods: The protocol acquires two CBCT scans with a linear translation of treatment couch in the patient plane, allowing a 1 cm penumbral overlap (i.e. cone beam abutment) and fused as a single DICOM set (CBCTeLFOV) using a custom-developed software script (coded in MatLab®) for extended localization. Systemic validation was performed to evaluate the geometric and Hounsfield Units accuracy at the overlapping regions of the CBCTeLFOV using a Catphan®-504 phantom. Two case studies were used to illustrate the CBCTeLFOV-based IGART workflow in terms of dosimetric and clinical perspectives. Segmentation accuracy/association between repeat CT (re-CT) and CBCTeLFOV was evaluated. Moreover, the efficacy of the CBCTeLFOV image data in deformable registration was also described. Results: Slice geometry, spatial resolution, line profiles and HU accuracy in the overlapping regions of the CBCTeLFOV yielded identical results when compared with reference CBCT. In patient studies, the dice-similarity-coefficient evaluation showed a good association (>0.9) between re-CT and CBCTeLFOV. Dosimetric analysis of the CBCTeLFOV-based adaptive re-plans showed excellent agreement with re-CT based re-plans. Moreover, a similar and consistent pattern of results was also observed using deformed image data (initial planning CT deformed to CBCTeLFOV) with extended longitudinal projection and the same frame-of-reference as that of the CBCTeLFOV. Conclusion: Utilization of CBCTeLFOV proves to be clinically appropriate and enables accurate prediction of geometric and dosimetric consequences within the planned course of treatment. The ability to compute CBCTeLFOV-based treatment plans equivalent to re-CT promises a potential improvement in IGART practice.},

Eleven different commercial plastic filaments were assessed by measuring their mean HU on CT images of small cubes printed with different patterns. The HU values were proportional to the mean effective density of the cubes. Polylactic acid (PLA) filaments were chosen. They had good printing characteristics and acceptable HU. Such filaments obtained from two different vendors were then tested by printing two sets of cubes comprising 10 and 6 cubes with 100% to 20% and 100% to 50% infill densities, respectively. They were printed with different printing patterns named “Regular” and “Bricks,” respectively. It was found that the HU values measured on the CT images of the 3D-printed cubes were proportional to the infill density with slight differences between vendors and printers. The Regular pattern with infill densities of about 30%, 90%, and 100% were found to produce HUs equivalent to lung, fat, and muscle. This was confirmed with histograms of the respective region of interest (ROI). The assessment of popular 3D-printing materials resulted in the choice of PLA, which together with the proposed technique was found suitable for the adequate simulation of the muscle, fat, and lung HU in printed patient-specific phantoms.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop phantoms for the optimization of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scans of the prostate artery, which are used for embolization planning. Methods: Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pellets were doped with barium sul-fate and extruded into filaments suitable for 3D printing on a fused deposition mod-eling (FDM) printer. Cylinder phantoms were created to evaluate radiopacity as a function of doping percentage. Small-diameter tree phantoms were created to assess their composition and dimensional accuracy. A half-pelvis phantom was created using clinical CT images, to assess the printer's control over cortical bone thickness and cancellous bone attenuation. CT-derived prostate artery phantoms were created to simulate complex, contrast-filled arteries. Results: A linear relationship (R = 0.998) was observed between barium sulfate added (0%-10% by weight), and radiopacity (À31 to 1454 Hounsfield Units [HU]). Micro-CT scans showed even distribution of the particles, with air pockets comprising 0.36% by volume. The small vessels were found to be oversized by a consistent amount of 0.08 mm. Micro-CT scans revealed that the phantoms' interiors were completely filled in. The maximum HU values of cortical bone in the phantom were lower than that of the filament, a result of CT image reconstruction. Creation of cancellous bone regions with lower HU values, using the printer's infill parameter, was successful. Direct volume renderings of the pelvis and prostate artery were similar to the clinical CT, with the exception that the surfaces of the phantom objects were not as smooth. Conclusions: It is possible to reliably create FDM 3D printer filaments with predictable radiopacity in a wide range of attenuation values, which can be used to print dimensionally accurate radiopaque objects derived from CT data. Phantoms of this type can be quickly and inexpensively developed to assess and optimize CT protocols for specific clinical applications.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

NIR fluorescent inclusions are comprised of ICG-labeled polystyrene divinylbenzene beads and Pam78-labeled hydroxyapatite crystals. The former mimic tumor masses of controllable size and contrast agent concentration, and the latter mimic microcalcifications in breast cancer. NIR-fluorescent inclusions can be positioned precisely in phantoms, with one or more regions having different optical properties, and their position can be verified independently using microcomputed tomography.

Methods The CT values of a number of materials were measured on an Aquilion One CT scanner at 80 kVp, 120 kVp and a Tomotherapy Hi Art MVCT imaging beam. Attenuation of the materials in a 6 MV radiotherapy beam was investigated. Results Plastic filaments printed with various infill densities have CT values of −743 ± 4, −580 ± 1 and −113 ± 3 in 120 kVp CT images which approximate the CT values of low-density lung, high-density lung and soft tissue respectively. Metal-infused plastic filaments printed with a 90% infill density have CT values of 658 ± 1 and 739 ± 6 in MVCT images which approximate the attenuation of cortical bone. The effective relative electron density REDeffis used to describe the attenuation of a megavoltage treatment beam, taking into account effects relating to the atomic number and mass density of the material. Plastic filaments printed with a 90% infill density have REDeffvalues of 1.02 ± 0.03 and 0.94 ± 0.02 which approximate the relative electron density RED of soft tissue. Printed resins have REDeffvalues of 1.11 ± 0.03 and 1.09 ± 0.03 which approximate the RED of bone mineral. Conclusions 3D printers can model a variety of body tissues which can be used to create phantoms useful for both imaging and dosimetric studies.},

It has even been suggested that errors as great as 800 years might arise between datings on the same sample made in different laboratories (Crowe, 1958). In the light of such criticism, it is clearly of the utmost importance to investigate, and, if possible, justify the basic assumptions on which the validity of the method rests.},

   abstract = {Optical spectroscopy, imaging, and therapy tissue phantoms must have the scattering and absorption properties that are characteristic of human tissues, and over the past few decades, many useful models have been created. In this work, an overview of their composition and properties is outlined, by separating matrix, scattering, and absorbing materials, and discussing the benefits and weaknesses in each category. Matrix materials typically are water, gelatin, agar, polyester or epoxy and polyurethane resin, room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone, or polyvinyl alcohol gels. The water and hydrogel materials provide a soft medium that is biologically and biochemically compatible with addition of organic molecules, and are optimal for scientific laboratory studies. Polyester, polyurethane, and silicone phantoms are essentially permanent matrix compositions that are suitable for routine calibration and testing of established systems. The most common three choices for scatters have been: (1.) lipid based emulsions, (2.) titanium or aluminum oxide powders, and (3.) polymer microspheres. The choice of absorbers varies widely from hemoglobin and cells for biological simulation, to molecular dyes and ink as less biological but more stable absorbers. This review is an attempt to indicate which sets of phantoms are optimal for specific applications, and provide links to studies that characterize main phantom material properties and recipes. © 2006 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To develop and evaluate methods for assembling radiopaque printed paper sheets to realistic patient phantoms for CT dose and image quality testing. Methods: CT images of two patients were radiopaque printed with aqueous potassium iodide solution (0.6 g/ml) on paper. Two methods were developed for assembling the paper sheets to head and neck phantoms. (1) Printed sheets were fed to a paper-based 3D printer along with corresponding 3D printable STL files. (2) Paper stacks of 5-mm thickness were glued with toner, cut to the patient shape and assembled to a phantom. In a sample application study, both phantoms were examined with five different tube current settings. Images were reconstructed using filtered-back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (AIDR 3D) with three strength levels. Dose length product (DLP), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were analysed. Data were analysed using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Both methods achieved anthropomorphic phantoms with detailed patient anatomy. The 3D printer yielded a precise reproduction of the external patient shape, but caused visible glue artefacts. Gluing with toner avoided these artefacts and yielded more flexibility with regard to phantom size. In the sample application study, non-inferior SNR and CNR and up to 83.7% lower DLP were achieved on the phantoms with AIDR 3D compared with FBP. Conclusions: Two methods for assembling radiopaque printed paper sheets to phantoms of individual patients are presented. The sample application demonstrates potential for simulation of patient imaging and systematic CT dose and image quality assessment. Key Points: • Two methods were developed to create realistic CT phantoms of individual patients from radiopaque printed paper sheets. • Analysis of five tube current and four reconstruction settings on two radiopaque 3D printed patient phantoms yielded non-inferior SNR and CNR and up to 83.7% lower dose with iterative reconstruction in comparison with filtered back projection. • Radiopaque 3D printed phantoms can simulate patients and allow systematic analysis of CT dose and image quality parameters.},

By embedding OSL-active particles into a transparent silicone matrix (PDMS), the well-established dosimetric properties of an OSL material are exploited in a 3D-OSL dosimeter. By investigating prototype dosimeters in standard cuvettes in combination with small test samples for OSL readers, it is shown that a sufficient transparency of the 3D-OSL material can be combined with an OSL response giving an estimated >10.000 detected photons in 1 second per 1mm3 voxel of the dosimeter at a dose of 1 Gy. The dose distribution in the 3D-OSL dosimeters can be directly read out optically without the need for subsequent reconstruction by computational inversion algorithms. The dosimeters carry the advantages known from personal-dosimetry use of OSL: the dose distribution following irradiation can be stored with minimal fading for extended periods of time, and dosimeters are reusable as they can be reset, e.g. by an intense (bleaching) light field.},

   abstract = {Stray light causes artifacts in optical computed tomography (CT) that negatively affect the accuracy of radiation dosimetry in gels or solids. Scatter effects are exacerbated by a large dosimeter volume, which is desirable for direct verification of modern radiotherapy treatment plans such as multiple-isocenter radiosurgery. The goal in this study was to design and characterize an optical CT system that achieves high accuracy primary transmission measurements through effective stray light rejection, while maintaining sufficient scan speed for practical application. We present an optical imaging platform that uses a galvanometer mirror for horizontal scanning, and a translation stage for vertical movement of a laser beam and small area detector for minimal stray light production and acceptance. This is coupled with a custom lens-shaped optical CT aquarium for parallel ray sampling of projections. The scanner images 15 cm diameter, 12 cm height cylindrical volumes at 0.33 mm resolution in approximately 30 min. Attenuation coefficients reconstructed from CT scans agreed with independent cuvette measurements within 2% for both absorbing and scattering solutions as well as small 1.25 cm diameter absorbing phantoms placed within a large, scattering medium that mimics gel. Excellent linearity between the optical CT scanner and the independent measurement was observed for solutions with between 90% and 2% transmission. These results indicate that the scanner should achieve highly accurate dosimetry of large volume dosimeters in a reasonable timeframe for clinical application to radiotherapy dose verification procedures.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Arthrodesis is one of the most widely accepted surgical recommended methods for tumors of the talus, but it may be associated with poor limb functions. The aim of this study was to present a novel reconstruction with ankle function preserved after en bloc talus tumor resection. Patient and method: A 43-year-old female with mesenchymal sarcoma of the talus was admitted in West China Hospital. Total talar replacement with three-dimensional (3D) printed modular prosthesis was prepared for reconstruction. The 3D printed modular prosthesis was designed exactly as the mirror image of the contralateral talus with complete filling of the sinus tarsi and subtalar joint space. The upper modular component of prosthesis was made of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, and the lower component, titanium alloy. Pre-drilled holes in three directions were prepared for screw fixation of the subtalar joint. Results: The patient underwent en bloc talus resection through anterior approach, followed by reconstruction with the 3D printed prosthesis. The whole procedure took 2 hours, and intra-operative blood loss was 50 mL. At the last follow-up, our patient was disease free and she could walk almost normally without any aid or pain. The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 26/30. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score was 91/100. The range of motion for dorsi-flexion and plantar flexion was 40°. And no abnormalities were observed in the roentgenograph. Conclusion: Total talar replacement with a 3D printed modular prosthesis may be an effective procedure for patients with tumors of the talus as it could maintain ankle function.},

   abstract = {A multiple-slit collimator (MSC) design was introduced for scatter reduction in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Unlike most other collimators, the open and closed septa of the proposed MSC are placed in an equi-angular interval on a circular track of the central sagittal plane. Therefore, one gantry rotation provides only the half of necessary dataset and two gantry rotations are needed to obtain full information. During the first gantry rotation, the MSC position relative to the source is fixed. For the second rotation, the MSC is rotated by the equi-angle interval. We assume signals under the closed septa are totally attributed to scatter radiation. Then, scatter contributions under open septa are determined by interpolating them. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for two virtual phantoms (one with a simple geometry and the other with two heterogeneities simulating the bone and the lung) were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. Using the method developed, we could obtain images with significant scatter reduction. Contrast ratio (CR) improvement factors were 1.165 in a 2D projection view, and 1.210 and 1.223 at the central and peripheral slice of the reconstructed CBCT image of the simple geometry phantom. This preliminary study demonstrated that the proposed MSC, together with the imaging process technique, had a great potential to reduce scatter contribution in CBCT. Further studies will be performed to investigate the effect of various factors, such as reducing the detector size, increasing the number of history of MC simulation, and including many structures with different densities.},

   abstract = {Optical cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) using a broad beam and CCD camera is a fast method for densitometry of 3D optical gel dosimeters. However, diffuse light sources introduce considerable stray light into the imaging system, leading to underestimation of attenuation coefficients and non-uniformities in CT images unless corrections are applied to each projection image. In this study, the light source of a commercial optical CT scanner is replaced with a convergent cone beam source consisting of almost exclusively image forming primary rays. The convergent source is achieved using a small isotropic source and a Fresnel lens. To characterize stray light effects, full-field cone beam CT imaging is compared to fan beam CT (FBCT) using a 1 cm high fan beam aperture centered on the optic axis of the system. Attenuating liquids are scanned within a large 96 mm diameter uniform phantom and in a small 13.5 mm diameter finger phantom. For the uniform phantom, cone and fan beam CT attenuation coefficients agree within a maximum deviation of (1±2)% between mean values over a wide range from 0.036 to 0.43 cm-1. For the finger phantom, agreement is found with a maximum deviation of (4 ± 2)% between mean values over a range of 0.1-0.47 cm-1. With the convergent source, artifacts associated with refractive index mismatch and vessel optical features are more pronounced. Further optimization of the source size to achieve a balance between quantitative accuracy and artifact reduction should enable practical, accurate 3D dosimetry, avoiding time consuming 3D scatter measurements.},

   abstract = {Cone beam optical computed tomography (OptCT) employing the VISTA scanner (Modus Medical, London, ON) has been shown to have significant promise for fast, three dimensional imaging of polymer gel dosimeters. One distinct challenge with this approach arises from the combination of the cone beam geometry, a diffuse light source, and the scattering polymer gel media, which all contribute scatter signal that perturbs the accuracy of the scanner. Beam stop array (BSA), beam pass array (BPA) and anti-scatter polarizer correction methodologies have been employed to remove scatter signal from OptCT data. These approaches are investigated through the use of well-characterized phantom scattering solutions and irradiated polymer gel dosimeters. BSA corrected scatter solutions show good agreement in attenuation coefficient with the optically absorbing dye solutions, with considerable reduction of scatter-induced cupping artifact at high scattering concentrations. The application of BSA scatter corrections to a polymer gel dosimeter lead to an overall improvement in the number of pixel satisfying the (3%, 3mm) gamma value criteria from 7.8% to 0.15%. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Several batches of gels were prepared with varying concentrations of EDTA incorporated in the FXGConv gel.

Dosimetric parameters including the optical background absorbance of the unirradiated gel, stability of dose after irradiation, self-oxygenation (auto-oxidation) and dose response were studied using a spectrophotometer at 585 nm. Based on the response of the EDTA infused FXGConv gels, further investigations were carried out on FXG-Glycine gels incorporated with EDTA. Diffusion coefficient measurements were performed on large volume phantoms irradiated in a linear accelerator. Optical transmittance of unirradiated FXG-Glycine gels improved approximately 40% with EDTA while maintaining acceptable control over Fe2+ auto-oxidation as well as Fe3+ diffusion. An optimal concentration of EDTA in the glycine-based FXG gel dosimeter can provide an overall benefit with low background absorbance and acceptable diffusion control while using lower bloom gelatin for preparation of gel dosimeters.},

   abstract = {As complex treatment techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) entail the modeling of rounded leaf-end transmission in the treatment planning system, it is important to accurately determine the dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) value for a precise calculation of dose. The advancements in the application of the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) in quality assurance (QA) and dosimetry have facilitated the determination of DLG in this study. The DLG measurements were performed using both the ionization chamber (DLGion) and EPID (DLGEP|D) for sweeping gap fields of different widths. The DLGion values were found to be 1.133 mm and 1.120 mm for perpendicular and parallel orientations of the 0.125 cm³ ionization chamber, while the corresponding DLGEP|D values were 0.843 mm and 0.819 mm, respectively. It was found that the DLG was independent of volume and orientation of the ionization chamber, depth, source to surface distance (SSD), and the rate of dose delivery.

   abstract = {Fricke gel dosimeters (FXGs) have been the preferred dosimeters because of its ease in preparation and water and tissue equivalency. Visible changes happen three dimensionally in the dosimeter as the ferrous (Fe2+) ions change into ferric (Fe3+) ions upon irradiation and the measure of this change can be correlated to the dose absorbed. Nanoparticles are promising entities that can improve the sensitivity of the gel dosimeter. Cerium Oxide nanoparticle was investigated for possible enhancement of absorbed dose in the FXG. Various concentrations of the nanoparticle based gel dosimeters were prepared and irradiated for a clinical dose range of 0-3 Gy in a telegamma unit. The optimal concentration of 0.1 mM nanoparticle incorporated in the FXG enhances the radiation sensitivity of the unmodified FXG taken as reference without modifying the background absorbance prior to irradiation. The gel recipe consisted of 5% (wt) gelatin, 50 mM Sulphuric acid, 0.05 mM Xylenol Orange, 0.5 mM Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate and 0.1 mM Cerium (IV) Oxide nanoparticle (< 25 nm particle size) and triple distilled water. The FXGs with nanoparticle showed linear dose response in the dose range tested.},

   abstract = {As complex treatment techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) entail the modeling of rounded leaf-end transmission in the treatment planning system, it is important to accurately determine the dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) value for a precise calculation of dose. The advancements in the application of the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) in quality assurance (QA) and dosimetry have facilitated the determination of DLG in this study. The DLG measurements were performed using both the ionization chamber (DLG<inf>ion</inf>) and EPID (DLG<inf>EPID</inf>) for sweeping gap fields of different widths. The DLG<inf>ion</inf> values were found to be 1.133 mm and 1.120 mm for perpendicular and parallel orientations of the 0.125 cm<sup>3</sup> ionization chamber, while the corresponding DLG<inf>EPID</inf> values were 0.843 mm and 0.819 mm, respectively. It was found that the DLG was independent of volume and orientation of the ionization chamber, depth, source to surface distance (SSD), and the rate of dose delivery. Since the patient-specific QA tests showed comparable results between the IMRT plans based on the DLG<inf>EPID</inf> and DLG<inf>ion</inf>, it is concluded that the EPID can be a suitable alternative in the determination of DLG.},

   abstract = {Optical cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scanning of 3D radiochromic dosimeters may provide a practical method for 3D dose verification in radiation therapy. However, in cone-beam geometry stray light contaminates the projection images, degrading the accuracy of reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients. Stray light was measured using a beam pass aperture array (BPA) and structured illumination methods. The stray-to-primary ray ratio (SPR) along the central axis was found to be 0.24 for a 5% gelatin hydrogel, representative of radiochromic hydrogels. The scanner was modified by moving the spectral filter from the detector to the source, changing the light’s spatial fluence pattern and lowering the acceptance angle by extending distance between the source and object. These modifications reduced the SPR significantly from 0.24 to 0.06. The accuracy of the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficients for uniform carbon black liquids was compared to independent spectrometer measurements. Reducing the stray light increased the range of accurate transmission readings. In order to evaluate scanner performance for the more challenging application to small field dosimetry, a carbon black finger gel phantom was prepared. Reconstructions of the phantom from CBCT and fan-beam CT scans were compared. The modified source resulted in improved agreement. Subtraction of residual stray light, measured with BPA or structured illumination from each projection further improved agreement. Structured illumination was superior to BPA for measuring stray light for the smaller 1.2 and 0.5 cm diameter phantom fingers. At the costs of doubling the scanner size and tripling the number of scans, CBCT reconstructions of low-scattering hydrogel dosimeters agreed with those of fan-beam CT scans.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scanning is used daily or weekly (i.e., on-treatment CBCT) for accurate patient setup in image-guided radiotherapy. However, inaccuracy of CT numbers prevents CBCT from performing advanced tasks such as dose calculation and treatment planning. Motivated by the promising performance of deep learning in medical imaging, we propose a deep U-net-based approach that synthesizes CT-like images with accurate numbers from planning CT, while keeping the same anatomical structure as on-treatment CBCT. Methods: We formulated the CT synthesis problem under a deep learning framework, where a deep U-net architecture was used to take advantage of the anatomical structure of on-treatment CBCT and image intensity information of planning CT. U-net was chosen because it exploits both global and local features in the image spatial domain, matching our task to suppress global scattering artifacts and local artifacts such as noise in CBCT. To train the synthetic CT generation U-net (sCTU-net), we include on-treatment CBCT and initial planning CT of 37 patients (30 for training, seven for validation) as the input. Additional replanning CT images acquired on the same day as CBCT after deformable registration are utilized as the corresponding reference. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sCTU-net, we use another seven independent patient cases (560 slices) for testing. Results: We quantitatively compared the resulting synthetic CT (sCT) with the original CBCT image using deformed same-day pCT images as reference. The averaged accuracy measured by mean absolute error (MAE) between sCT and reference CT (rCT) on testing data is 18.98 HU, while MAE between CBCT and rCT is 44.38 HU. Conclusions: The proposed sCTU-net can synthesize CT-quality images with accurate CT numbers from on-treatment CBCT and planning CT. This potentially enables advanced CBCT applications for adaptive treatment planning.},

Based on anonymized human chest CT images, the phantom contained a 3D-printed skin shell, filled with tissue equivalent materials with similar radiation attenuation characteristics. The filling materials were a mixture of CaCO 3 , MgO, agarose, NaCl, pearl powder and silica gel. The dose calculation accuracy of different treatment planning system (TPS) algorithms was validated and compared with the ion chamber measurements in the phantom, including tumor and surrounding normal tissues. The chest phantom was shown to represent a human’s chest in terms of radiation attenuation property and human anatomy. The Hounsfield unit ranges were −60 to −100, 20 to 60, and 120 to 300 for fat, muscle, and bone, respectively. The actual measured values of the ionization chamber were 213.7 cGy for the tumor, 53.85 cGy for normal lung tissue, and 4.1 cGy for the spinal cord, compared to 214.1, 55.2, and 4.5 cGy, respectively, with use of the Monte Carlo algorithm in TPS.

There is a substantial demand for in vitro organ phantoms, especially in urological surgery. Animal models and existing simulator systems poorly mimic the detailed morphology and the physical properties of human organs. In this paper, we report a novel fabrication process to make a human kidney phantom with realistic anatomical structures and physical properties. The detailed anatomical structure was directly acquired from high resolution CT data sets of human cadaveric kidneys. The soft phantoms were constructed using a novel technique that combines 3D wax printing and polymer molding. Anatomical details and material properties of the phantoms were validated in detail by CT scan, ultrasound, and endoscopy. CT reconstruction, ultrasound examination, and endoscopy showed that the designed phantom mimics a real kidney’s detailed anatomy and correctly corresponds to the targeted human cadaver’s upper urinary tract. Soft materials with a tensile modulus of 0.8–1.5 MPa as well as biocompatible hydrogels were used to mimic human kidney tissues. We developed a method of constructing 3D organ models from medical imaging data using a 3D wax printing and molding process. This method is cost-effective means for obtaining a reproducible and robust model suitable for surgical simulation and training purposes.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Develop a technique to fabricate a 3D anthropomorphic breast phantom with known ground truth for image quality assessment of 2D and 3D breast x-ray imaging systems. Methods: The phantom design is based on an existing computer model that can generate breast voxel phantoms of varying composition, size, and shape. The physical phantom is produced in two steps. First, the portion of the voxel phantom consisting of the glandular tissue, skin, and Cooper's ligaments is separated into sections. These sections are then fabricated by high-resolution rapid prototyping using a single material with 50% glandular equivalence. The remaining adipose compartments are then filled using an epoxy-based resin EBR with 100% adipose equivalence. The phantom sections are stacked to form the physical anthropomorphic phantom. Results: The authors fabricated a prototype phantom corresponding to a 450 ml breast with 45% dense tissue, deformed to a 5 cm compressed thickness. Both the rapid prototype RP and EBR phantom materials are radiographically uniform. The coefficient of variation CoV of the relative attenuation between RP and EBR phantom samples was 1% and the CoV of the signal intensity within RP and EBR phantom samples was 1.5% on average. Digital mammography and reconstructed digital breast tomosynthesis images of the authors' phantom were reviewed by two radi-ologists; they reported that the images are similar in appearance to clinical images, noting there are still artifacts from air bubbles in the EBR. Conclusions: The authors have developed a technique to produce 3D anthropomorphic breast phantoms with known ground truth, yielding highly realistic x-ray images. Such phantoms may serve both qualitative and quantitative performance assessments for 2D and 3D breast x-ray imaging systems.},

This study investigated the feasibility of building a deep convolutional neural network for MRI-based S-CT generation and evaluated the dosimetric accuracy on prostate IMRT planning. Methods: A paired CT and T2-weighted MR images were acquired from each of 51 prostate cancer patients. Fifteen pairs were randomly chosen as tested set and the remaining 36 pairs as training set. The training subjects were augmented by applying artificial deformations and feed to a two-dimensional U-net which contains 23 convolutional layers and 25.29 million trainable parameters. The U-net represents a nonlinear function with input an MR slice and output the corresponding S-CT slice. The mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield unit (HU) between the true CT and S-CT images was used to evaluate the HU estimation accuracy. IMRT plans with dose 79.2 Gy prescribed to the PTV were applied using the true CT images. The true CT images then were replaced by the S-CT images and the dose matrices were recalculated on the same plan and compared to the one obtained from the true CT using gamma index analysis and absolute point dose discrepancy. Results: The U-net was trained from scratch in 58.67 h using a GP100-GPU. The computation time for generating a new S-CT volume image was 3.84–7.65 s. Within body, the (mean ± SD) of MAE was (29.96 ± 4.87) HU. The 1%/1 mm and 2%/2 mm gamma pass rates were over 98.03% and 99.36% respectively. The DVH parameters discrepancy was less than 0.87% and the maximum point dose discrepancy within PTV was less than 1.01% respect to the prescription. Conclusion: The U-net can generate S-CT images from conventional MR image within seconds with high dosimetric accuracy for prostate IMRT plan.},

   abstract = {The ultimate goal of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is to deliver truly customized radiation treatments. Currently, the quality of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is still inferior to that of conventional CT images in contour delineations and dose calculations for replanning purposes. This retrospective study aims to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of using deformed conventional CT images for dose calculations, in the hope of inferring the feasibility of ART using planning CT (PCT) images that deformed to up-to-date CBCT images for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Thirty consecutive patients with NPC who had undergone 1 replan in their radiotherapy treatments were selected. The pretreatment PCT images were deformed to match the mid-treatment PCT images by deformable image registration. The same volumetric modulated arc therapy plan was then calculated on the deformed PCT images. The resulting dose distributions and dose volume histograms of the tumors and organs at risk (OARs) were compared with the original plan. Five dose levels, D98%, D95%, D50%, D5%, and D2%, were recorded for 9 NPC targets. Four dose levels, Dmax, D10%, D50%, and Dmean, were recorded for 15 OARs. The greatest percentage difference in observed dose for D98%, D95%, D50%, D5%, and D2% of the targets were 1.71%, 1.55%, 0.64%, 0.97%, and 1.13%, respectively. The greatest percentage difference in observed dose for Dmax, D10%, D50%, and Dmean of the OARs were -26.51% (left optic nerve), -17.06% (left optic nerve), 56.70% (spinal cord), and 18.97% (spinal cord), respectively. In addition, 29 of 45 (64%) dosimetric end points of the targets showed statistically significant dose differences (p <0.05) between the original plan and the plan calculated on deformed images. Forty-nine of 60 (82%) dosimetric end points of the OARs also showed statistically significant dose differences (p <0.05). Dose calculations using deformed PCT images could result in significant dose uncertainties in target volumes and OARs. Larger dose deviations were found in OARs in comparison with target volumes. The spinal cord and optic nerve showed the greatest percentage dose differences and the clinical significance has yet to be determined. Deformable registration error was believed to be the problem causing the dose deviations. Owing to unknown clinical significanceof dose deviation results obtained from this study, a conventional CT scan is still required for replanning in patients with NPC who are experiencing significant anatomical changes during the course of radiation treatment.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autocontouring improves workflow in computed tomography (CT)-based dose planning, but could also potentially play a role for optimal use of daily cone beam CT (CBCT) in adaptive radiotherapy. This study aims to determine the accuracy of a deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm for organs at risk (OAR) in the neck region, when applied to CBCT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For 30 head and neck cancer (HNC) patients 14 OARs including parotid glands, swallowing structures and spinal cord were delineated. Contours were propagated by DIR from CT to the CBCTs of the first and last treatment fraction. An indirect approach, propagating contours to the first CBCT and from there to the last CBCT was also tested. Propagated contours were compared to manually corrected contours by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD). Dose was recalculated on CBCTs and dosimetric consequences of uncertainties in DIR were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean DSC values of ≥0.8 were considered adequate and were achieved in tongue base (0.91), esophagus (0.85), glottic (0.81) and supraglottic larynx (0.83), inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (0.84), spinal cord (0.89) and all salivary glands in the first CBCT. For the last CBCT by direct propagation, adequate DSC values were achieved for tongue base (0.85), esophagus (0.84), spinal cord (0.87) and all salivary glands. Using indirect propagation only tongue base (0.80) and parotid glands (0.87) were ≥0.8. Mean relative dose difference between automated and corrected contours was within ±2.5% of planed dose except for esophagus inlet (-4.5%) and esophagus (5.0%) for the last CBCT using indirect propagation. CONCLUSION: Compared to manually corrected contours, the DIR algorithm was accurate for use in CBCT images of HNC patients and the minor inaccuracies had little consequence for mean dose in most clinically relevant OAR. The method can thus enable a more automated segmentation of CBCT for use in adaptive radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {Background and purpose: Changes in tumor size during the course of radiotherapy warrant performing adaptive radiotherapy (ART). This work investigates the feasibility and usefulness of acquiring on-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) for ART for patients with bulky head and neck tumors treated with IMRT and for prostate patients with potentially signiﬁcant target position variations during the treatment course. Materials and methods: A phantom designed for CT quality assurance was used to compare the dosimetric and geometric accuracy between conventional CT and CBCT from a linear accelerator’s on-board imager. Patient planning CT and CBCT images were acquired before treatment and at mid-course. The IMRT plans made on the CT were applied to the CBCT and dose–volume histograms were calculated. Results: In both phantom and patient studies, the dose–volume histograms (DVHs) based on CBCT images were in excellent agreement with DVHs based on planning CT images. Minimum, maximum and mean doses agreed very well. In a patient study, doses for targets and normal tissues from the same IMRT plans calculated on CBCT images agreed within 1–3% with those calculated on planning CT images. Conclusions: CBCT images can be used to accurately predict dosimetric results. It is feasible to use CBCT to determine dosimetric consequences resulting from tumor shrinkage and patient geometry changes. An additional planning CT may be necessary to perform IMRT re-planning at present in order to accurately delineate tumor and organs. The CBCT has potential to become a very useful tool for on-line ART.},

   abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery of multiple brain metastases represents a clinical challenge requiring extended treatment times in the case of multiple multi-focal and poly-isocenteric plans. Using a single isocenter is a more efﬁcient dose delivery, but is subject to planning complications and sensitive to errors in localization and rotational registration. Pre-treatment patient-speciﬁc quality assurance is essential to ensure proper dose delivery to multiple targets. The use of a gel dosimeter may facilitate this process and allow for the veriﬁcation of dose delivery in a customized patient-emulating phantom. Materials/Methods: An inversely-optimized volumetrically modulated arc therapy plan was devised in a Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system to treat six targets throughout the brain. Targets varied in volume from 0.058 cc to 5.074 cc. In addition, a larger 5.39 cc target was treated to a homogeneous dose in a region where phantoms facilitating the insertion of ﬁlm and an ion chamber could be used. The 3D dose distribution was measured throughout the brain with a gel dosimeter. The phantom was localized with cone-beam CT in conjunction with a six-degree-of-freedom treatment table. Results: The 3D dose distribution obtained from the MRI scan of the phantom post-irradiation was compared with the 3D DICOM exported dose from the treatment planning system. 3D gamma analysis in the larger QA target revealed a 94.3% passing rate with 3%/2mm criteria. Dose volume histograms agreed well with planning dose volume histograms. Mean dose in all targets matched calculations within 3%. Absolute dose veriﬁcation measurement with an ionization chamber showed agreement within 1.3% while 2D gamma analysis for the ﬁlm insert at 3%/2mm showed a passing rate of 95.7%. Conclusion: The 3D gel dosimetry can be an effective quality assurance tool for the dosimetric veriﬁcation and localization accuracy of stereotactic radiosurgery on a patient-speciﬁc basis. Comparisons between measured and calculated dose distributions showed good agreement with the advantage of measurements being made in a phantom geometry which closely mimics that of the patient’s anatomy.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Due to the increased axial coverage of multislice computed tomography (CT) and the introduction of flat detectors, the size of x-ray illumination fields has grown dramatically, causing an increase in scatter radiation. For CT imaging, scatter is a significant issue that introduces shading artifact, streaks, as well as reduced contrast and Hounsfield Units (HU) accuracy. The purpose of this work is to provide a fast and accurate scatter artifacts correction algorithm for cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging. Methods: The method starts with an estimation of coarse scatter profiles for a set of CBCT data in either image domain or projection domain. A denoising algorithm designed specifically for Poisson signals is then applied to derive the final scatter distribution. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations using thorax and abdomen phantoms with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, experimental Catphan phantom data, and in vivo human data acquired for a clinical image guided radiation therapy were performed. Scatter correction in both projection domain and image domain was conducted and the influences of segmentation method, mismatched attenuation coefficients, and spectrum model as well as parameter selection were also investigated. Results: Results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce scatter artifacts and recover the correct HU in either projection domain or image domain. For the MC thorax phantom study, fourcomponents segmentation yields the best results, while the results of three-components segmentation are still acceptable. The parameters (iteration number K and weight β) affect the accuracy of the scatter correction and the results get improved as K and β increase. It was found that variations in attenuation coefficient accuracies only slightly impact the performance of the proposed processing. For the Catphan phantom data, the mean value over all pixels in the residual image is reduced from −21.8 to −0.2 HU and 0.7 HU for projection domain and image domain, respectively. The contrast of the in vivo human images is greatly improved after correction. Conclusions: The software-based technique has a number of advantages, such as high computational efficiency and accuracy, and the capability of performing scatter correction without modifying the clinical workflow (i.e., no extra scan/measurement data are needed) or modifying the imaging hardware. When implemented practically, this should improve the accuracy of CBCT image quantitation and significantly impact CBCT-based interventional procedures and adaptive radiation therapy.

   abstract = {Purpose or Objective: To determine the analysis parameters for quantitative assessment of the dosimetric impact of differences between the measured and calculated MVCT detectors sinograms. This difference is directly related to patient positioning and/or anatomical changes. Material and Methods: Tomotherapy HD v5.0 associated to Delivery Analysis (DA) software (beta version) has been used for patient treatments. Consistency of MLC functioning is assessed by comparing opening-closing time measured by detectors versus calculated during planning. The quality assurance of the device validates its functioning. Detector response stability is continuously monitored (sd/mean<0.05%). DA software analyzes the difference of the detectors sinogram between a reference fraction and the fraction of the day, its influence is measured through the patient. The specific differences to a patient will therefore depend on its positioning and/or anatomical variations. From the analysis of each treatment session, alert thresholds will be defined. Results: Considering margins used and expected dose accuracy, parameters of 2mm (DTA) and 3% (dose) were used associated to a threshold of 99% for gamma index analysis. We use them as a baseline to verify detectability on various treatments. With this level of detectability, the presence of gas in pelvic localizations, a loss of weight linked to a variation of 5mm thickness is detected. In the context of lung tumors, a reduction in tumor volume (associated with lung density change) is detected. The interpretation of these differences is not easy because of the movement of such gases, we have then added a condition for further analysis: three consecutive fractions not meeting the criterion result in a complete analysis or 15% of non consecutive fractions (conventional fractionation). A less than 95% result is immediately analyzed to determine visually on the MVCT scanner the reason : if it is weight loss, a new planning is realized. Conclusion: Two strong points should be noted: a color code is associated to analysis results (red/green : fail/pass) and permits a relevant and fast systematic analysis. This information also applies to non-imaged areas, such as for medulloblastoma: although the MVCT is not acquired over the},

   abstract = {Cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging has become an integral part of radiation therapy, with images typically used for offline or online patient setup corrections based on bony anatomy co-registration. Ideally, the co-registration should be based on tumor localization. However, soft tissue contrast in CBCT images may be limited. In the present work, contrast enhanced CBCT (CECBCT) images were used for tumor visualization and treatment adaptation. Material and methods. A spontaneous canine maxillary tumor was subjected to repeated cone beam CT imaging during fractionated radiotherapy (10 fractions in total). At five of the treatment fractions, CECBCT images, employing an iodinated contrast agent, were acquired, as well as pre-contrast CBCT images. The tumor was clearly visible in post-contrast minus pre-contrast subtraction images, and these contrast images were used to delineate gross tumor volumes. IMRT dose plans were subsequently generated. Four different strategies were explored: 1) fully adapted planning based on each CECBCT image series, 2) planning based on images acquired at the first treatment fraction and patient repositioning following bony anatomy co-registration, 3) as for 2), but with patient repositioning based on co-registering contrast images, and 4) a strategy with no patient repositioning or treatment adaptation. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and tumor control probability (TCP) calculations to estimate treatment outcome for each strategy. Results. Similar translation vectors were found when bony anatomy and contrast enhancement co-registration were compared. Strategy 1 gave EUDs closest to the prescription dose and the highest TCP. Strategies 2 and 3 gave EUDs and TCPs close to that of strategy 1, with strategy 3 being slightly better than strategy 2. Even greater benefits from strategies 1 and 3 are expected with increasing tumor movement or deformation during treatment. The non-adaptive strategy 4 was clearly inferior to all three adaptive strategies. Conclusion. CECBCT may prove useful for adaptive radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {A system for cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) based on a flat-panel imager (FPI) is used to examine the magnitude and effects of x-ray scatter in FPI-CBCT volume reconstructions. The system is being developed for application in image-guided therapies and has previously demonstrated spatial resolution and soft-tissue visibility comparable or superior to a conventional CT scanner under conditions of low x-ray scatter. For larger objects consistent with imaging of human anatomy (e.g., the pelvis) and for increased cone angle (i.e., larger volumetric reconstructions), however, the effects of x-ray scatter become significant. The magnitude of x-ray scatter with which the FPI-CBCT system must contend is quantified in terms of the scatter-to-primary energy fluence ratio (SPR) and scatter intensity profiles in the detector plane, each measured as a function of object size and cone angle. For large objects and cone angles (e.g., a pelvis imaged with a cone angle of 6°), SPR in excess of 100% is observed. Associated with such levels of x-ray scatter are cup and streak artifacts as well as reduced accuracy in reconstruction values, quantified herein across a range of SPR consistent with the clinical setting. The effect of x-ray scatter on the contrast, noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in FPI-CBCT reconstructions was measured as a function of SPR and compared to predictions of a simple analytical model. The results quantify the degree to which elevated SPR degrades the CNR. For example, FPI-CBCT images of a breast-equivalent insert in water were degraded in CNR by nearly a factor of 2 for SPR ranging from ∼2% to 120%. The analytical model for CNR provides a quantitative understanding of the relationship between CNR, dose, and spatial resolution and allows knowledgeable selection of the acquisition and reconstruction parameters that, for a given SPR, are required to restore the CNR to values achieved under conditions of low x-ray scatter. For example, for SPR=100%, the CNR in FPI-CBCT images can be fully restored by: (1) increasing the dose by a factor of 4 (at full spatial resolution); (2) increasing dose and slice thickness by a factor of 2; or (3) increasing slice thickness by a factor of 4 (with no increase in dose). Other reconstruction parameters, such as transaxial resolution length and reconstruction filter, can be similarly adjusted to achieve CNR equal to that obtained in the scatter-free case.},

   abstract = {Objective: Cone beam CT (CBCT) images contain more scatter than a conventional CT image and therefore provide inaccurate Hounsfield units (HUs). Consequently, CBCT images cannot be used directly for radiotherapy dose calculation. The aim of this study is to enable dose calculations to be performed with the use of CBCT images taken during radiotherapy and evaluate the necessity of replanning.  Methods: A patient with prostate cancer with bilateral metallic prosthetic hip replacements was imaged using both CT and CBCT. The multilevel threshold (MLT) algorithm was used to categorize pixel values in the CBCT images into segments of homogeneous HU. The variation in HU with position in the CBCT images was taken into consideration. This segmentation method relies on the operator dividing the CBCT data into a set of volumes where the variation in the relationship between pixel values and HUs is small. An automated MLT algorithm was developed to reduce the operator time associated with the process. An intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan was generated from CT images of the patient. The plan was then copied to the segmented CBCT (sCBCT) data sets with identical settings, and the doses were recalculated and compared.  Results: Gamma evaluation showed that the percentage of points in the rectum with γ < 1 (3%/3 mm) were 98.7% and 97.7% in the sCBCT using MLT and the automated MLT algorithms, respectively. Compared with the planning CT (pCT) plan, the MLT algorithm showed −0.46% dose difference with 8 h operator time while the automated MLT algorithm showed −1.3%, which are both considered to be clinically acceptable, when using collapsed cone algorithm.  Conclusion: The segmentation of CBCT images using the method in this study can be used for dose calculation. For a patient with prostate cancer with bilateral hip prostheses and the associated issues with CT imaging, the MLT algorithms achieved a sufficient dose calculation accuracy that is clinically acceptable. The automated MLT algorithm reduced the operator time associated with implementing the MLT algorithm to achieve clinically acceptable accuracy. This saved time makes the automated MLT algorithm superior and easier to implement in the clinical setting.  Advances in knowledge: The MLT algorithm has been extended to the complex example of a patient with bilateral hip prostheses, which with the introduction of automation is feasible for use in adaptive radiotherapy, as an alternative to obtaining a new pCT and reoutlining the structures.},

   abstract = {Background: Accurate target localization is mandatory in the accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivery. Dosimetric verification for positional error will further guarantee the accuracy of treatment delivery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical feasibility of a cone beam computer tomographic (CBCT) image correction method in APBI. Methods: A CBCT image correction method was developed. First, rigid image registration was proceeded for CTs and CBCTs; second, these images were separated into four parts; then, ratio images for each of the four parts of planning CTs/CBCTs were calculated and filtered to reduce the high spatial frequency; finally, the enhanced CBCT images were generated combing the four parts. An anthropomorphic thorax rando phantom was used to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of the CBCT correction method. The CBCT images of consecutive 10 patients receiving APBI were corrected using the above method and dosimetric variations were evaluated. Each set of CBCT is composed of three images: one acquired after skin-marker setup, one after online setup correction and one after treatment delivery. Results: The phantom study showed the improved accuracy of dose calculation with corrected CBCT. The Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) difference between the planning CT and corrected CBCT is less than the difference between the planning CT and original CBCT. The maximum dose difference between the corrected CBCT and planning CT is 0.8% in PTV_EVAL V100, which is 3.8% between original CBCT and planning. In the patient study, 67.4% of fractions benefit from CBCT setup corrections in PTV_EVAL D95, while in 47.4% of the fractions, reduced dose coverage was found on the post-treatment CBCT. Overall, the CBCT based initial setup correction guaranteed target dose coverage in 9 patients. Conclusions: A generic CBCT image correction algorithm was created and proved to be easily implemented in clinic. Compared to the original CBCT, the corrected CBCT has more accuracy in dose calculation. The CBCT guided APBI based on initial skin setup is not sufficient to guarantee the accurate dose delivery throughout each fraction. The long treatment delivery time may compromise the target coverage benefits in some patients.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of using computed tomography (CT) to cone-beam CT (CBCT) deformable image registration (DIR) for the application of calculating the “dose of the day” received by a head and neck patient. Methods: NiftyReg is an open-source registration package implemented in our institution. The affine registration uses a Block Matching-based approach, while the deformable registration is a GPU implementation of the popular B-spline Free Form Deformation algorithm. Two independent tests were performed to assess the suitability of our registrations methodology for “dose of the day” calculations in a deformed CT. A geometric evaluation was performed to assess the ability of the DIR method to map identical structures between the CT and CBCT datasets. Features delineated in the planning CT were warped and compared with features manually drawn on the CBCT. The authors computed the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), distance transformation, and centre of mass distance between features. A dosimetric evaluation was performed to evaluate the clinical significance of the registrations errors in the application proposed and to identify the limitations of the approximations used. Dose calculations for the same intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan on the deformed CT and replan CT were compared. Dose distributions were compared in terms of dose differences (DD), gamma analysis, target coverage, and dose volume histograms (DVHs). Doses calculated in a rigidly aligned CT and directly in an extended CBCT were also evaluated. Results: A mean value of 0.850 in DSC was achieved in overlap between manually delineated and warped features, with the distance between surfaces being less than 2 mm on over 90% of the pixels. Deformable registration was clearly superior to rigid registration in mapping identical structures between the two datasets. The dose recalculated in the deformed CT is a good match to the dose calculated on a replan CT. The DD is smaller than 2% of the prescribed dose on 90% of the bodyˈs voxels and it passes a 2% and 2 mm gamma-test on over 95% of the voxels. Target coverage similarity was assessed in terms of the 95%-isodose volumes. A mean value of 0.962 was obtained for the DSC, while the distance between surfaces is less than 2 mm in 95.4% of the pixels. The method proposed provided adequate dose estimation, closer to the gold standard than the other two approaches. Differences in DVH curves were mainly due to differences in the OARs definition (manual vs warped) and not due to differences in dose estimation (dose calculated in replan CT vs dose calculated in deformed CT). Conclusions: Deforming a planning CT to match a daily CBCT provides the tools needed for the calculation of the “dose of the day” without the need to acquire a new CT. The initial clinical application of our method will be weekly offline calculations of the “dose of the day,” and use this information to inform adaptive radiotherapy (ART). The work here presented is a first step into a full implementation of a “dose-driven” online ART.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a novel method to monitor external anatomical changes in head and neck cancer patients in order to triage possible adaptive radiotherapy needs.
METHODS: The presented approach aims to provide information on internal anatomical changes based on variations observed in external anatomy. Setup Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) images are processed to produce an accurate external contour of the patient's skin. After registering the CBCTs to the reference planning CT, the external contours from each CBCT are transferred to the initial - first week - CBCT. Contour radii, defined as the distances between an external contour and the isocenter projection in each CBCT slice, are calculated for each scan over the full 360 degrees. The changes in external anatomy are then quantified by the difference in radial distance between the external contours of any secondary CBCT relative to the initial CBCT. Finally, the radial difference is displayed in cylindrical coordinates as a 2D intensity map to highlight regions of interests with significant changes. Weekly CBCT scans from 15 head and neck patients were retrospectively analyzed to demonstrate the utility of this approach as a proof of principle. External changes suggested by the 2D radial difference map of an example patient after 23 fractions were then correlated with the changes in the gross tumor volumes and organs at risks. The resulting dosimetric effects were evaluated. An interactive standalone software application has been developed to facilitate the generation and the interpretation of the 2D intensity map.
RESULTS: The 2D radial difference maps provided qualitative and quantitative information, such as the location and the magnitude of external contour changes and the rate at which these deviations occur. Out of the 15 patients, 10 presented clear evidence of general external volume shrinkage due to weight loss, and nine patients had at least one site of local shrinkage. Only two patients showed no signs of anatomical change during their entire treatment course. For the example patient, the mean (±σ) radial difference was 6.7 (±3.0) mm for the left parotid and 7.3 (±2.5) mm for the right parotid. The mean dose to the left and right parotids increased from 20.1 Gy to 30 Gy and from 16.3 Gy to 29.6 Gy, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This novel method provides an efficient tool to visualize 3D external anatomical changes on a single 2D map. It quickly pinpoints the location of differences in anatomy during the course of radiotherapy, which can help physicians determine if a treatment plan needs to be adapted. The interactive graphic user interface developed in this study will be evaluated in an adaptive radiotherapy workflow for head and neck patients in a future prospective trial.},

To validate the ability and accuracy of DIR algorithms in organ at risk (OAR) contours mapping, seven intensity-based DIR strategies are tested on the planning CT and weekly CBCT images from six Head & Neck cancer patients who underwent a 6 ∼ 7 weeks intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three similarity metrics, i.e. the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the percentage error (PE) and the Hausdorff distance (HD), are employed to measure the agreement between the propagated contours and the physician delineated ground truths. It is found that the performance of all the evaluated DIR algorithms declines as the treatment proceeds. No statistically significant performance difference is observed between different DIR algorithms (p>0.05), except for the double force demons (DFD) which yields the worst result in terms of DSC and PE. For the metric HD, all the DIR algorithms behaved unsatisfactorily with no statistically significant performance difference (p= 0.273). These findings suggested that special care should be taken when utilizing the intensity-based DIR algorithms involved in this study to deform OAR contours between CT and CBCT, especially for those organs with low contrast.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the geometric accuracy of beam targeting in external surrogate-based gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) using kilovoltage (kV) x-ray images acquired during dose delivery. Methods: Gated VMAT treatments were delivered using a Varian TrueBeam STx Linac for both physical phantoms and patients. Multiple gold fiducial markers were implanted near the target. The reference position was created for each implanted marker, representing its correct position at the gating threshold. The gating signal was generated from the RPM system. During the treatment, kV images were acquired immediately before MV beam-on at every breathing cycle, using the on-board imaging system. All implanted markers were detected and their 3D positions were estimated using in-house developed software. The positioning error of a marker is defined as the distance of the marker from its reference position for each frame of the images. The overall error of the system is defined as the average over all markers. For the phantom study, both sinusoidal motion (1D and 3D) and real human respiratory motion was simulated for the target and surrogate. In the baseline case, the two motions were synchronized for the first treatment fraction. To assess the effects of surrogate-target correlation on the geometric accuracy, a phase shift of 5 and 10 between the two motions was introduced. For the patient study, intrafraction kV images of five stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients were acquired for one or two fractions. Results: For the phantom study, a high geometric accuracy was achieved in the baseline case (average error: 0.8 mm in the superior-inferior or SI direction). However, the treatment delivery is prone to geometric errors if changes in the target-surrogate relation occur during the treatment: the average error was increased to 2.3 and 4.7 mm for the phase shift of 5 and 10, respectively. Results obtained with real human respiratory curves show a similar trend. For a target with 3D motion, the technique is able to detect geometric errors in the left-right (LR) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions. For the patient study, the average intrafraction positioning errors are 0.8, 0.9, and 1.4 mm and 95th percentile errors are 1.7, 2.1, and 2.7 mm in the LR, AP, and SI directions, respectively. Conclusions: The correlation between external surrogate and internal target motion is crucial to ensure the geometric accuracy of surrogate-based gating. Real-time guidance based on kV x-ray images overcomes the potential issues in surrogate-based gating and can achieve accurate beam targeting in gated VMAT. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Respiratory-gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (gated VMAT) involves further complexities to the dose delivery process because the gantry rotation must repeatedly stop and restart according to the gating signals. In previous studies, the gantry rotation performances were evaluated by the difference between the plan and the machine log. However, several reports pointed out that log analysis does not sufficiently replicate the machine performance. In this report, a measurement-based quality assurance of the relation between the gantry angle and gate-on or gate-off using triggered kilovoltage imaging and a cylinder phantom with 16 ball bearings is proposed. For the analysis, an in-house program that estimates and corrects the phantom offset was developed. The gantry angle in static and gated arc delivery was compared between the machine log and the proposed method. The gantry was set every 5 deg through its full motion range in static delivery, and rotated at three speeds (2, 4 and 6 deg s-1) with different gating intervals (1.5 or 3.0 s) in gated arc delivery. The mean and standard deviation of the angular differences between the log and the proposed method was −0.05 deg ± 0.12 deg in static delivery. The mean of the angular difference was within ±0.10 deg and the largest difference was 0.41 deg in gated arc delivery. The log records the output of the encoder so that miscalibration and mechanical sagging will be disregarded. However, the proposed method will help the users to detect the mechanical issues due to the repeated gantry stops and restarts in gated VMAT.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To compare the dosimetric impact and treatment delivery efficacy of phase-gated volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) vs amplitude-gated VMAT for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for lung cancer by using realistic three-dimensional-printed phantoms. Methods: Four patient-specific moving lung phantoms that closely simulate the heterogeneity of lung tissue and breathing patterns were fabricated with four planning computed tomography (CT) images for lung SBRT cases. The phantoms were designed to be bisected for the measurement of two-dimensional dose distributions by using EBT3 dosimetry film. The dosimetric accuracy of treatment under respiratory motion was analyzed with the gamma index (2%/1 mm) between the plan dose and film dose measured under phase- and amplitude-gated VMAT. For the validation of the direct usage of the real-time position management (RPM) data for respiratory motion, the relationship between the RPM signal and the diaphragm position was measured by four-dimensional CT. By using data recorded during the beam delivery of both phase- and amplitude-gated VMAT, the total time intervals were compared for each treatment mode. Results: Film dosimetry showed a 5.2 ± 4.2% difference of gamma passing rate (2%/1 mm) on average between the phase- vs amplitude-gated VMAT [77.7% (72.7%–85.9%) for the phase mode and 82.9% (81.4%–86.2%) for the amplitude mode]. For delivery efficiency, frequent interruptions were observed during the phase-gated VMAT, which stopped the beam delivery and required a certain amount of time before resuming the beam. This abnormality in phase-gated VMAT caused a prolonged treatment delivery time of 366 s compared with 183 s for amplitude-gated VMAT. Conclusions: Considering the dosimetric accuracy and delivery efficacy between the gating methods, amplitude mode is superior to phase mode for gated VMAT treatment.},

Materials and methods: A heterogeneous anthropomorphic multi-modality abdominal deformable phantom was comprised of MR and CT anatomically-relevant materials. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were affixed within regions of interest (ROIs). CT and MR simulation scans were acquired. CT was deformed to MR for dose calculations. MRgoART was executed on a MR-linac (MRIdian) for 5 Gy/5 fractions. Before each fraction, a deformation was applied. Ground truth was known for ROI volume, TLD position, and TLD dose measured by an accredited dosimetry calibration laboratory. To validate the range of applied deformations, phantom DVFs were compared to DVFs of clinical abdominal MRgoART fractions. MR-MR deformation accuracy was quantified through dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean distance-to-agreement (MDA), and as mean-absolute-error (MAE) for CT-MR-MR deformation. Arithmetic-summation of calculated dose at respective TLD positions and deform-accumulated dose (MIM) was compared to TLD measured dose, respectively. MR-MR deformation statistics were quantified for MRIdian and MIM. Results: Mean phantom DVFs were 5.0 ± 2.9 mm compared to mean DVF of clinical abdominal patients at 5.2 ± 3.0 mm. Respective mean DSC, HD, MDA was 0.93 ± 0.03, 0.74 ± 0.80 cm, 0.08 ± 0.03 cm for MRIdian and 0.93 ± 0.03, 0.54 ± 0.27 cm, 0.08 ± 0.03 cm for MIM (N = 80 ROIs). Mean MAE was 20.5 HU. Respective mean and median dose differences were 0.3%, −0.3% for arithmetic-summation and 4.1%, 0.6% for deformed-accumulation. Maximum differences were 0.21 Gy (arithmetic-summation), 0.31 Gy (deformed-accumulation). Conclusions: MRgoART deformation and dosimetric accuracy has been benchmarked for mean fractional DVFs of 5 mm in a multiple-rigid-body deformable phantom. Deformation accuracy was within TG132 criteria and clinically acceptable end-to-end MRgoART dosimetric agreement was observed for this phantom.

   abstract = {Purpose: To utilize a deformable phantom to objectively evaluate the accuracy of 11 different deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms. Methods: The phantom represents an axial plane of the pelvic anatomy. Urethane plastic serves as the bony anatomy and urethane rubber with three levels of Hounsfield units (HU) is used to represent fat and organs, including the prostate. A plastic insert is placed into the phantom to simulate bladder filling. Nonradiopaque markers reside on the phantom surface. Optical camera images of these markers are used to measure the positions and determine the deformation from the bladder insert. Eleven different DIR algorithms are applied to the full and empty-bladder computed tomography images of the phantom (fixed and moving volumes, respectively) to calculate the deformation. The algorithms include those from MIM Software (MIM) and Velocity Medical Solutions (VEL) and nine different implementations from the deformable image registration and adaptive radiotherapy toolbox for Matlab. These algorithms warp one image to make it similar to another, but must utilize a method for regularization to avoid physically unrealistic deformation scenarios. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the HUs at the marker locations on one image and the calculated location on the other serves as a metric to evaluate the balance between image similarity and regularization. To demonstrate the effect of regularization on registration accuracy, an additional beta version of MIM was created with a variable smoothness factor that controls the emphasis of the algorithm on regularization. The distance to agreement between the measured and calculated marker deformations is used to compare the overall spatial accuracy of the DIR algorithms. This overall spatial accuracy is also utilized to evaluate the phantom geometry and the ability of the phantom soft-tissue heterogeneity to represent patient data. To evaluate the ability of the DIR algorithms to accurately transfer anatomical contours, the rectum is delineated on both the fixed and moving images. A Dice similarity coefficient is then calculated between the contour on the fixed image and that transferred, via the calculated deformation, from the moving to the fixed image. Results: The phantom possesses sufficient soft-tissue heterogeneity to act as a proxy for patient data. Large discrepancies appear between the algorithms and the measured ground-truth deformation. VEL yields the smallest mean spatial error and a Dice coefficient of 0.90. MIM produces the lowest MAD value and the highest Dice coefficient of 0.96, but creates the largest spatial errors. Increasing the MIM smoothness factor above the default value improves the overall spatial accuracy, but the factor associated with the lowest mean error decreases the Dice coefficient to 0.85. Conclusions: Different applications of DIR require disparate balances between image similarity and regularization. A DIR algorithm that is optimized only for its ability to transfer anatomical contours will yield large deformation errors in homogeneous regions, which is problematic for dose mapping. For this reason, these algorithms must be tested for their overall spatial accuracy. The developed phantom is an objective tool for this purpose. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Deformable (non-rigid) registration is an essential tool in both adaptive radiation therapy and image-guided radiation therapy to account for soft-tissue changes during the course of treatment. The evaluation method most commonly used to assess the accuracy of deformable image registration is qualitative human evaluation. Here, we propose a method for systematically measuring the accuracy of an algorithm in recovering artificially introduced deformations in cases of rigid geometry, and we use that method to quantify the ability of a modified basis spline (B-Spline) registration algorithm to recover artificially introduced deformations. The evaluation method is entirely computer-driven and eliminates biased interpretation associated with human evaluation; it can be applied to any chosen method of image registration. Our method involves using planning computed tomography (PCT) images acquired with a conventional CT simulator and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images acquired daily by a linear accelerator-mounted kilovoltage image system in the treatment delivery room. The deformation that occurs between the PCT and daily CBCT images is obtained using a modified version of the B-Spline deformable model designed to overcome the low soft-tissue contrast and the artifacts and distortions observed in CBCT images. Clinical CBCT images and contours of phantom and central nervous system cases were deformed (warped) with known random deformations. In registering the deformed with the non-deformed image sets, we tracked the algorithm's ability to recover the original, non-deformed set. Registration error was measured as the mean and maximum difference between the original and the registered surface contours from outlined structures. Using this approach, two sets of tests can be devised. To measure the residual error related to the optimizer's convergence performance, the warped CBCT image is registered to the unwarped version of itself, eliminating unknown factors such as noise and positioning errors. To study additional errors introduced by artifacts and noise in the CBCT image, the warped CBCT image is registered to the original PCT image. Using a B-Spline deformable image registration algorithm, mean residual error introduced by the algorithm's performance on noise-free images was less than 1 mm, with a maximum of 2 mm. The chosen deformable image registration model was capable of accommodating significant variability in structures over time, because the artificially introduced deformation magnitude did not significantly influence the residual error. On the second type of test, noise and artifacts reduced registration accuracy to a mean of 1.33 mm and a maximum of 4.86 mm. The accuracy of deformable image registration can be easily and consistently measured by evaluating the algorithm's ability to recover artificially introduced deformations in rigid cases in which the true solution is known a priori. The method is completely automated, applicable to any chosen registration algorithm, and does not require user interaction of any kind.},

   abstract = {The algorithm for hybrid DIR in RayStation is called ANACONDA ("anatomically constrained deformation algorithm"). ANACONDA combines image information, such as intensities, with anatomical information provided by contoured image sets. This makes it possible to maintain the integrity of anatomical structures, even in areas where image information is less reliable. Algorithms that are purely based on image information are limited as they can only regularize the deformation field by applying some degree of smoothing. The supported image modalities are CT, CBCT and MR. It has been validated that ANACONDA performs well in comparison with other algorithms and that it gives good results for CT/CT¹ and CT/CBCT DIR⁶. ANACONDA has also been applied in MR/MR DIR (same sequence)⁷. It is interesting to note that accuracy results for deformable registration can vary significantly between centers because different routines are followed. A recent study found that RayStation gave higher levels of accuracy than the other systems evaluated when effective routines for deformable registration were employed¹. The study also showed good results for default settings and independently confirmed some of the results of a 2015 study by Weistrand and Svensson⁶. Algorithmic details ANACONDA is based on a mathematical formulation where the registration problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem and addressed with a specifically tailored solver that was developed in-house. The objective function is a weighted sum of three non-linear terms:},

   abstract = {Purpose: Three-dimensional (3D) printing allows for the fabrication of medical devices with complex geometries, such as soft actuators and robots that can be used in image-guided interventions. This study investigates flexible and rigid 3D-printing materials in terms of their impact on multimodal medical imaging. Methods: The generation of artifacts in clinical computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was evaluated for six flexible and three rigid materials, each with a cubical and a cylindrical geometry, and for one exemplary flexible fluidic actuator. Additionally, CT Hounsfield units (HU) were quantified for various parameter sets iterating peak voltage, x-ray tube current, slice thickness, and convolution kernel. Results: We found the image artifacts caused by the materials to be negligible in both CT and MR images. The HU values mainly depended on the elemental composition of the materials and applied peak voltage was ranging between 80 and 140 kVp. Flexible, nonsilicone-based materials were ranged between 51 and 114 HU. The voltage dependency was less than 29 HU. Flexible, silicone-based materials were ranged between 60 and 365 HU. The voltage-dependent influence was as large as 172 HU. Rigid materials ranged between −69 and 132 HU. The voltage-dependent influence was <33 HU. Conclusions: All tested materials may be employed for devices placed in the field of view during CT and MR imaging as no significant artifacts were measured. Moreover, the material selection in CT could be based on the desired visibility of the material depending on the application. Given the wide availability of the tested materials, we expect our results to have a positive impact on the development of devices and robots for image-guided interventions.},

   abstract = {Development of patient-specific CT imaging phantoms with randomly incorporated lesions of various shapes and sizes for calibrating image intensity and validating quantitative measurement software is very challenging. In this investigation, a physical phantom that accurately represents a patient's specific anatomy and the intensity of lung CT images at the voxel level will be fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. Segmentation and modeling of a patient's CT data were performed by an expert and the results were confirmed by a thoracic radiologist with more than 20 years of experience. This facilitated the extraction of the details of the patient's anatomy; various kinds of nodules with different shapes and sizes were randomly added to the modeled lung for evaluating the size-accuracy of the quantification software. To achieve these Hounsfield Units (HU) ranges for the corresponding voxels in acquired CT scans, the infill ratios of FDM 3D printing were controlled. Based on CT scans of the 3D printed phantoms, the measured HU for normal pulmonary parenchyma, ground glass opacity (GGO), and solid nodules were determined to be within target HU ranges. The accuracy of the mean absolute difference and the mean relative difference of nodules were less than 0.55plusmn;0.30mm and 3.72±1.64% (mean difference±95 CI), respectively. Patient-specific CT imaging phantoms were designed and manufactured using an FDM printer, which could be applied for the precise calibration of CT intensity and the validation of image quantification software.},

   abstract = {Liver cancer is currently the third deadliest cancer in the world, affecting over 700,000 people per year. To improve early detection of tumours, perfusion testing is used for imaging of blood flow in the liver. Creating a phantom to accurately mimic the liver in imaging techniques such as Dynamic Contrast-enhanced (DCE) computed tomography (CT) will improve testing and calibration of different imaging protocols and pharmacokinetic perfusion models. In current literature, there lacks a permeable, easily producible and reusable liver phantom for dynamic contrast-enhanced CT perfusion testing. This study details the production of phantoms with controllable permeability for standardization in hepatic perfusion using commercially available 3D printing methods. Phantoms with hexagonal channels were designed in nTopology Element and printed in materials with a density of 0.9–1.5 g/cm3. Polylactic acid was selected for fused deposition modelling (FDM), while proprietary resins were used for an inkjet printing process called MultiJet Printing (MJP). Permeability tests were performed on samples to observe flow rates obeying Darcy's Law. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze pore size in FDM and MJP samples, while micro-CT scans were performed to analyze pore interconnectivity. The collected permeability data exceeds reported literature values of 0.0167 mL s−1 cm2 and approach the desired range of 0.15–0.3 mL s−1 cm2. Micro-CT scans show obstructions from the MJP printing process. SEM images were analyzed in Fiji and showed varying results for FDM printing. Future work will involve reducing pore size while maintaining high permeability. Using 3D printing in phantom development will help create adaptable, reliable and permeable phantoms for diagnostic imaging.},

Materials and methods: After IRB exemption, patient CT scans were anonymized and downloaded as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files to prepare for conversion. These files were converted to stereolithography format for 3D printing. Important soft tissue structures were identified and labeled to be printed in a separate color than bone. Models were printed using a desktop 3D printer (Ultimaker 3 Extended, Ultimaker BV, Netherlands) and polylactic acid (PLA) filament. 10 junior residents with no previous drilling experience participated in the study. Each resident was asked to drill a simple mastoidectomy on both a cadaveric and 3D printed temporal bone. Following their experience, they were asked to complete a Likert questionnaire. Results: The final result was an anatomically accurate (XYZ accuracy = 12.5, 12.5, 5 μm) 3D model of a temporal bone that was deemed to be appropriate in tactile feedback using the surgical drill. The total cost of the material required to fabricate the model was approximately $1.50. Participants found the 3D models overall to be similar to cadaveric temporal bones, particularly in overall value and safety. Conclusions: 3D printed temporal bone models can be used as an affordable and inexhaustible alternative, or supplement, to traditional cadaveric surgical simulation.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Single four-dimensional CT (4DCT) scans reliably capture intrafractional tumor mobility for radiotherapy planning, but generating internal target volumes (ITVs) requires the contouring of gross tumor volumes (GTVs) in up to 10 phases of a 4DCT scan, as is routinely performed in our department. We investigated the use of maximum intensity projection (MIP) protocols for rapid generation of ITVs. Methods and Materials: 4DCT data from a mobile phantom and from 12 patients with Stage I lung cancer were analyzed. A single clinician contoured GTVs in all respiratory phases of a 4DCT, as well as in three consecutive phases selected for respiratory gating. MIP images were generated from both phantom and patient data, and ITVs were derived from encompassing volumes of the respective GTVs. Results: In the phantom study, the ratio between ITVs generated from all 10 phases and those from MIP scans was 1.04. The corresponding center of mass of both ITVs differed by less than 1 mm. In scans from patients, good agreement was observed between ITVs derived from 10 and 3 (gating) phases and corresponding MIPs, with ratios of 1.07 ± 0.05 and 0.98 ± 0.05, respectively. In addition, the center of mass of the respective ITVs differed by only 0.4 and 0.5 mm. Conclusion: MIPs are a reliable clinical tool for generating ITVs from 4DCT data sets, thereby permitting rapid assessment of mobility for both gated and nongated 4D radiotherapy in lung cancer. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Respiration-gated radiotherapy can permit the irradiation of smaller target volumes. 4DCT scans performed for routine treatment were retrospectively analyzed to establish the benefits of gating in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods: Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) were contoured in all 10 respiratory phases of a 4DCT scan in 15 patients with stage III NSCLC. Treatment planning was performed using different planning target volumes (PTVs), namely: (i) PTVroutine, derived from a single GTV plus 'conventional' margins; (ii) PTVallphases incorporating all 3D mobility captured by the 4DCT; (iii) PTVgating, incorporating residual 3D mobility in 3-4 phases at end-expiration. Mixed effect models were constructed in order to estimate the reductions in risk of lung toxicity for the different PTVs. Results: Individual GTVs ranged from 41.5 - 235.0 cm3. With patient-specific mobility data (PTVallphases), smaller PTVs were derived than when 'standard' conventional margins were used (p < 0.001). The average residual 3D tumor mobility within the gating window was 4.0 ± 3.5 mm, which was 5.5 mm less than non-gated tumor mobility (p < 0.001). The reductions in mean lung dose were 9.7% and 4.9%, respectively, for PTVallphases versus PTVroutine, and PTVgating versus PTVallphases. The corresponding reductions in V20 were 9.8% and 7.0%, respectively. Dosimetric gains were smaller for primary tumors of the upper lobe versus other locations (p = 0.02). Respiratory gating also reduced the risks of radiation-induced esophagitis. Conclusion: Respiration-gated radiotherapy can reduce the risk of pulmonary toxicity but the benefits are particularly evident for tumors of the middle and lower lobes. © 2006 Underberg et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {We report on the variability of the respiratory motion during 4D-PET/CT acquisition. The respiratory motion for five lung cancer patients was monitored by tracking external markers placed on the abdomen. CT data were acquired over an entire respiratory cycle at each couch position. The x-ray tube status was recorded by the tracking system, for retrospective sorting of the CT data as a function of respiration phase. Each respiratory cycle was sampled in ten equal bins. 4D-PET data were acquired in gated mode, where each breathing cycle was divided into ten 500 ms bins. For both CT and PET acquisition, patients received audio prompting to regularize breathing. The 4D-CT and 4D-PET data were then correlated according to their respiratory phases. The respiratory periods, and average amplitude within each phase bin, acquired in both modality sessions were then analyzed. The average respiratory motion period during 4D-CT was within 18% from that in the 4D-PET sessions. This would reflect up to 1.8% fluctuation in the duration of each 4D-CT bin. This small uncertainty enabled good correlation between CT and PET data, on a phase-to-phase basis. Comparison of the average-amplitude within the respiration trace, between 4D-CT and 4D- PET, on a bin-by-bin basis show a maximum deviation of ∼15%. This study has proved the feasibility of performing 4D-PET/CT acquisition. Respiratory motion was in most cases consistent between PET and CT sessions, thereby improving both the attenuation correction of PET images, and coregistration of PET and CT images. On the other hand, in two patients, there was an increased partial irregularity in their breathing motion, which would prevent accurately correlating the corresponding PET and CT images. © 2004 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

Here we discuss those challenges for three specific techniques related to motion-adaptive therapy: namely respiratory gating, breath holding, and four-dimensional computed tomography. Similar to the introduction of any other new technologies in clinical practice, typical QA measures should be taken for these techniques also, including initial testing of equipment and clinical procedures, as well as frequent QA examinations during the early stage of implementation. Here, rather than covering every QA aspect in depth, we focus on some major QA challenges. The biggest QA challenge for gating and breath holding is how to ensure treatment accuracy when internal target position is predicted using external surrogates. Recommended QA measures for each component of treatment, including simulation, planning, patient positioning, and treatment delivery and verification, are discussed. For four-dimensional computed tomography, some major QA challenges have also been discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We propose a new scanning protocol for generating 4D-CT image data sets influenced by respiratory motion. A cine scanning protocol is used during data acquisition, and two registration methods are used to sort images into temporal phases. A volume is imaged in multiple acquisitions of 1 or 2 cm length along the cranial-caudal direction. In each acquisition, the scans are continuously acquired for a time interval greater than or equal to the average respiratory cycle plus the duration of the data for an image reconstruction. The x ray is turned off during CT table translation and the acquisition is repeated until the prescribed volume is completely scanned. The scanning for 20 cm coverage takes about 1 min with an eight-slice CT or 2 mins with a four-slice CT. After data acquisition, the CT data are registered into respiratory phases based on either an internal anatomical match or an external respiratory signal. The internal approach registers the data according to correlation of anatomy in the CT images between two adjacent locations in consecutive respiratory cycles. We have demonstrated the technique with ROIs placed in the region of diaphragm. The external approach registers the image data according to an externally recorded respiratory signal generated by the Real-Time Position Management (RPM) Respiratory Gating System (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Compared with previously reported prospective or retrospective imaging of the respiratory motion with a single-slice or multi-slice CT, the 4D-CT method proposed here provides (1) a shorter scan time of three to six times faster than the single-slice CT with prospective gating; (2) a shorter scan time of two to four times improvement over a previously reported multi-slice CT implementation, and (3) images over all phases of a breathing cycle. We have applied the scanning and registration methods on phantom, animal and patients, and initial results suggest the applicability of both the scanning and the registration methods. © 2004 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Prospective respiratory-gated 4D CT has been shown to reduce tumor image artifacts by up to 50% compared to conventional 4D CT. However, to date no studies have quantified the impact of gated 4D CT on normal lung tissue imaging, which is important in performing dose calculations based on accurate estimates of lung volume and structure. To determine the impact of gated 4D CT on thoracic image quality, the authors developed a novel simulation framework incorporating a realistic deformable digital phantom driven by patient tumor motion patterns. Based on this framework, the authors test the hypothesis that respiratory-gated 4D CT can significantly reduce lung imaging artifacts. Methods: Our simulation framework synchronizes the 4D extended cardiac torso (XCAT) phantom with tumor motion data in a quasi real-time fashion, allowing simulation of three 4D CT acquisition modes featuring different levels of respiratory feedback: (i) "conventional" 4D CT that uses a constant imaging and couch-shift frequency, (ii) "beam paused" 4D CT that interrupts imaging to avoid oversampling at a given couch position and respiratory phase, and (iii) "respiratory-gated" 4D CT that triggers acquisition only when the respiratory motion fulfills phase-specific displacement gating windows based on prescan breathing data. Our framework generates a set of ground truth comparators, representing the average XCAT anatomy during beam-on for each of ten respiratory phase bins. Based on this framework, the authors simulated conventional, beam-paused, and respiratory-gated 4D CT images using tumor motion patterns from seven lung cancer patients across 13 treatment fractions, with a simulated 5.5 cm3 spherical lesion. Normal lung tissue image quality was quantified by comparing simulated and ground truth images in terms of overall mean square error (MSE) intensity difference, threshold-based lung volume error, and fractional false positive/false negative rates. Results: Averaged across all simulations and phase bins, respiratory-gating reduced overall thoracic MSE by 46% compared to conventional 4D CT (p ~ 10-19). Gating leads to small but significant (p 0.02) reductions in lung volume errors (1.8%-1.4%), false positives (4.0%-2.6%), and false negatives (2.7%-1.3%). These percentage reductions correspond to gating reducing image artifacts by 24-90 cm3 of lung tissue. Similar to earlier studies, gating reduced patient image dose by up to 22%, but with scan time increased by up to 135%. Beam paused 4D CT did not significantly impact normal lung tissue image quality, but did yield similar dose reductions as for respiratory-gating, without the added cost in scanning time. Conclusions: For a typical 6 L lung, respiratory-gated 4D CT can reduce image artifacts affecting up to 90 cm3 of normal lung tissue compared to conventional acquisition. This image improvement could have important implications for dose calculations based on 4D CT. Where image quality is less critical, beam paused 4D CT is a simple strategy to reduce imaging dose without sacrificing acquisition time.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated the accuracy of measuring the motion of an internal target using four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) scanning and the BrainLAB ExacTrac X-ray imaging system. Displacements of a metal coil implanted in a commercial respiratory phantom were measured in each system and compared to the known motion. A commercial respiratory motion phantom containing a metal coil as a surrogate target was used. Phantom longitudinal motions were sinusoidal with a 4.0 second period and amplitudes ranging from 5-25 mm. We acquired 4DCT and ExacTrac images of the coil at specified respiratory phases and recorded the coordinates of the coil ends. Coil displacement relative to the 0% phase (full-inhale) position were computed for the ExacTrac and 4DCT imaging systems. Coil displacements were compared to known displacements based on the phantom's sinusoidal motion. Coil length distortion due to 4DCT phase binning was compared to the known physical length of the coil (31 mm). The maximum localization error for both coil endpoints for all motion settings was 3.5 mm for the 4DCT and 0.8 mm for the ExacTrac gating system. Coil length errors measured on the 4DCT were less than 0.8 mm at end inhale/exhale phases, but up to 8.3 mm at mid-inhalation phases at the largest motion amplitude (25 mm). Due to the fast image acquisition time (100 ms), no coil distortion was observable in the ExacTrac system. 4DCT showed problems imaging the coil during mid-respiratory phases of higher velocity (phases 20%-30% and 70%-80%) due to distortion caused by residual motion within the 4DCT phase bin. The ExacTrac imaging system was able to accurately localize the coil in the respiratory phantom over all phases of respiration. For our clinic, where end-respiration phases from 4DCT may be used for treatment planning calculations, the ExacTrac system is used to measure internal target motion. With the ExacTrac system, planning target size and motion uncertainties are minimized, potentially reducing internal target volume margins in gated radiotherapy.},

The respiratory motion was simulated by a motor-driven plastic platform to move the phantom with a displacement of 2 cm in the craniocaudal direction at a frequency of 15/min. With the phantom at rest, PET/CT data were acquired and used as a standard (nonmotion). With the phantom in motion, PET data were acquired in both the static and gated modes (sPET and gPET, respectively). Helical CT (HCT), slow CT (SCT), average CT (ACT), and four-dimensional CT (4DCT) were acquired and used to correct attenuation. On both PET and CT images, the maximum radioactivity, dimensions, and CT numbers were measured on the central slices. Results In nonmotion, recovery coefficients whose spheres were 22 mm or smaller gradually decreased. Regarding motion, the PET counts of the spheres in the static acquisition were lower than those acquired in nonmotion with either type of CTAC (sPET-HCT:-43.8%, sPET-SCT:-51.4%, sPET-ACT:-49.5%). Gated acquisition of PET significantly improved the PET counts (gPET-HCT:-30.1%) (p < 0.05), while additional gated acquisition of CT significantly improved them further (gPET-4DCT:-15.2%) (p<0.01). The dimensions of sPET were overestimated, but those of gPET were close to the standard values. The SCT significantly overestimated the dimensions, and the water density area decreased (p<0.01). The 4DCT images were similar to the HCT images. Conclusions In respiratory motion, PET acquisition in the static mode underestimated the radioactivity and overestimated the dimensions. Neither SCT nor ACT improved these errors. Although PET acquisition in the gated mode improved the quantification of PET/CT images, the additional gated CT acquisition using 4DCT is required for further improvement. © The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine 2010.},

   abstract = {Purpose: MRI is increasingly being used for radiotherapy planning, simulation, and in-treatmentroom motion monitoring. To provide more detailed temporal and spatial MR data for these tasks, we have recently developed a novel self-gated (SG) MRI technique with advantage of k-space phase sorting, high isotropic spatial resolution, and high temporal resolution. The current work describes the validation of this 4D-MRI technique using a MRI- and CT-compatible respiratory motion phantom and comparison to 4D-CT. Methods: The 4D-MRI sequence is based on a spoiled gradient echo-based 3D projection reconstruction sequence with self-gating for 4D-MRI at 3 T. Respiratory phase is resolved by using SG k-space lines as the motion surrogate. 4D-MRI images are reconstructed into ten temporal bins with spatial resolution 1.56×1.56×1.56 mm3. A MRI-CT compatible phantom was designed to validate the performance of the 4D-MRI sequence and 4D-CT imaging. A spherical target (diameter 23 mm, volume 6.37 ml) filled with high-concentration gadolinium (Gd) gel is embedded into a plastic box (35×40×63 mm3) and stabilized with low-concentration Gd gel. The phantom, driven by an air pump, is able to produce human-type breathing patterns between 4 and 30 respiratory cycles/min. 4D-CT of the phantom has been acquired in cine mode, and reconstructed into ten phases with slice thickness 1.25 mm. The 4D images sets were imported into a treatment planning software for target contouring. The geometrical accuracy of the 4D MRI and CT images has been quantified using target volume, flattening, and eccentricity. The target motion was measured by tracking the centroids of the spheres in each individual phase. Motion ground-truth was obtained from input signals and real-time video recordings. Results: The dynamic phantom has been operated in four respiratory rate (RR) settings, 6, 10, 15, and 20/min, and was scanned with 4D-MRI and 4D-CT. 4D-CT images have target-stretching, partialmissing, and other motion artifacts in various phases, whereas the 4D-MRI images are visually free of those artifacts. Volume percentage difference for the 6.37 ml target ranged from 5.3%±4.3% to 10.3%±5.9% for 4D-CT, and 1.47±0.52 to 2.12±1.60 for 4D-MRI. With an increase of respiratory rate, the target volumetric and geometric deviations increase for 4D-CT images while remaining stable for the 4D-MRI images. Target motion amplitude errors at different RRs were measured with a range of 0.66-1.25 mm for 4D-CT and 0.2-0.42 mm for 4D-MRI. The results of Mann-Whitney tests indicated that 4D-MRI significantly outperforms 4D-CT in phase-based target volumetric (p = 0.027) and geometric (p < 0.001) measures. Both modalities achieve equivalent accuracy in measuring motion amplitude (p = 0.828). Conclusions: The k-space self-gated 4D-MRI technique provides a robust method for accurately imaging phase-based target motion and geometry. Compared to 4D-CT, the current 4D-MRI technique demonstrates superior spatiotemporal resolution, and robust resistance to motion artifacts caused by fast target motion and irregular breathing patterns. The technique can be used extensively in abdominal targeting, motion gating, and toward implementing MRI-based adaptive radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {Purpose: High local control rates have been reported with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. Because high-dose fractions are used, reduction in treatment portals will reduce the risk of toxicity to adjacent structures. Respiratory gating can allow reduced field sizes and planning four-dimensional computed tomography scans were retrospectively analyzed to study the benefits for gated SRT and identify patients who derive significant benefit from this approach. Methods and Materials: A total of 31 consecutive patients underwent a four-dimensional computed tomography scan, in which three-dimensional computed tomography datasets for 10 phase bins of the respiratory cycle were acquired during free breathing. For a total of 34 tumors, the three planning target volumes (PTVs) were analyzed, namely (1) PTV10bins, derived from an internal target volume (ITV) that incorporated all observed mobility (ITV10bins), with the addition of a 3-mm isotropic setup margin; (2) PTVgating, derived from an ITV generated from mobility observed in three consecutive phases ("bins") during tidal-expiration, plus addition of a 3-mm isotropic margin; and (3) PTV10 mm, derived from the addition of a 10-mm isotropic margin to the most central gross tumor volumes in the three bins selected for gating. Results: The PTV10bins and PTVgating were, on average, 48.2% and 33.3% of the PTV10 mm, and respective mean volumes of normal tissue (outside the PTV) receiving the prescribed doses were 57.1% and 39.1%, respectively, of that of PTV10 mm. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of tumor mobility (i.e., a three-dimensional mobility vector of at least 1 cm) and reduction in normal tissue irradiation achieved with gating. The ratio of the intersecting and the encompassing volumes of GTVs at extreme phases of tidal respiration predicted for the benefits of gated respiration. Conclusion: The use of "standard population-based" margins for SRT leads to unnecessary normal tissue irradiation. The risk of toxicity is further reduced if respiration-gated radiotherapy is used to treat mobile tumors. These findings suggest that gated SRT will be of clinical relevance in selected patients with mobile tumors. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {An image-guidance process for using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of peripheral lung lesions is presented. Respiration correlated CBCT on the treatment unit and four dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) from planning are evaluated for assessing respiration-induced target motion during planning and treatment fractions. Image-guided SBRT was performed for 12 patients (13 lesions) with inoperable early stage non-small cell lung carcinoma. Kilovoltage (kV) projections were acquired over a 360 degree gantry rotation and sorted based on the pixel value of an image-based aperture located at the air-tissue interface of the diaphragm. The sorted projections were reconstructed to provide volumetric respiration correlated CBCT image datasets at different phases of the respiratory cycle. The 4D volumetric datasets were directly compared with 4DCT datasets acquired at the time of planning. For ten of 12 patients treated, the lung tumour motion, as measured by respiration correlated CBCT on the treatment unit, was consistent with the tumour motion measured by 4DCT at the time of planning. However, in two patients, maximum discrepancies observed were 6 and 10 mm in the anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions, respectively. Respiration correlated CBCT acquired on the treatment unit allows target motion to be assessed for each treatment fraction, allows target localization based on different phases on the breathing cycle, and provides the facility for adaptive margin design in radiation therapy of lung malignancies. The current study has shown that the relative motion and position of the tumour at the time of treatment may not match that of the planning 4DCT scan. Therefore, application of breathing motion data acquired at simulation for tracking or gating radiation therapy may not be suitable for all patients - even those receiving short course treatment techniques such as SBRT. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Deformable registration is needed for a variety of tasks in establishing the voxel correspondence between respiratory phases. Most registration algorithms assume or imply that the deformation field is smooth and continuous everywhere. However, the lungs are contained within closed invaginated sacs called pleurae and are allowed to slide almost independently along the chest wall. This sliding motion is characterized by a discontinuous vector field, which cannot be generated using standard deformable registration methods. The authors have developed a registration method that can create discontinuous vector fields at the boundaries of anatomical subregions. Registration is performed independently on each subregion, with a boundary-matching penalty used to prevent gaps. This method was implemented and tested using both the B-spline and Demons registration algorithms in the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The authors have validated this method on four patient 4DCT data sets for registration of the end-inhalation and end-exhalation volumes. Multiple experts identified homologous points in the lungs and along the ribs in the two respiratory phases. Statistical analyses of the mismatch of the homologous points before and after registration demonstrated improved overall accuracy for both algorithms. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

First, to verify the detectability of Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x nanoparticles in imaging, in vivo tests were conducted. Approximately 600 mg kg −1 of 19 nm-diameter Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x nanoparticles dispersed in phosphate-buffered saline was injected into the tail vein of six Balb/c mice used as tumour (4T1 mammary carcinoma cell) models. Three mice underwent MRI (BioSpec 70/20 USR, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) and micro-CT (Inveon, Siemens Preclinical, Knoxville, TN, USA) before and after the injection. The difference between the pre-and post-injection images was quantified by finding the correlation coefficient. The aorta, blood vessel, and liver were clearly seen in the MRI and micro-CT images 60 min after intravenous injection of Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x nanoparticles, but the tumour region was not visible in the CT images until after 24 h. There were large differences between the pre-and post-injection images. Second, the therapeutic enhancement dose of nanomaterials was computed via Monte Carlo simulation. Monoenergetic 70-and 150 MeV proton beams irradiated x-ray contrast agent (iodine, BaSO 4), MRI contrast agent (gadolinium, Fe 3 O 4), Au, Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x (core/shell) nanoparticles and water located at the centre of a 4 × 4 × 4 µm 3 water phantom, upon which the dose enhancement ratio (DER) (dose with/without nanoparticles) was computed. When 70 MeV protons irradiated the Au, gadolinium, Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x , Fe 3 O 4 , iodine, and BaSO 4 nanoparticles, the DERs at 1 nm were 15.76, 7.68, 7.82, 6.17, 4.85, and 5.51, respectively. Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x nanoparticles have the potential to be used as a multifunctional agent that enhances tumour detection and increases the dose. Dose enhancement with Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x was half that with Au. However, Fe 3 O 4 /TaO x is much cheaper than Au, and it is expected that tumour targeting combined with magnetic field could overcome the low DER.},

   abstract = {Applicability and accuracy of the rapidly developing tools and workflows for image-guided radiotherapy need to be validated under realistic treatment-like conditions. We present the construction of the ADAM-pelvis phantom, an anthropomorphic, deformable and multimodal (CT and MRI) phantom of the male pelvis. The phantom covers patient-like uncertainties in image-guided radiotherapy workflows including imaging artifacts for the special case of the human anatomy as well as organ motion. Principles and methods were further improved from previous work. The phantom includes surrogates for muscle tissue, adipose, inner and outer bone, as well as deformable silicone organs. Anthropomorphic shapes are realized with 3D-printing techniques for the bone and the construction of the hollow silicone organ shells. Organs are constructed from patient image segmentation and further guided by reported deformation models. Imaging markers and pockets for dosimeters are included in the organ shells. The improved phantom surrogates match imaging characteristics in MRI (T1 and T2 relaxation time) and CT (Hounsfield units) of human tissues. The surrogates are suited for long term use (several months) of the phantom. Previously reported artifacts of the muscle surrogate were avoided by improved composition of the used agarose gel. Interfractional organ motion is successfully realized for the water filled bladder and the air filled rectum and showed to be reproducible with deviation below 1 mm. Volume variations of both induce displacement, rotation and deformation of the prostate. We present solutions for the construction of an anthropomorphic phantom suitable for MRI and CT imaging including deformable organs. The developed concepts of phantom surrogates and construction techniques were successfully applied in building the ADAM-pelvis phantom and can as well be adopted for other anthropomorphic phantoms. The presented phantom allows for the systematic and controlled investigation of image-guided radiotherapy workflows in presence of organ motion.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To develop a method to create anthropomorphic phantoms of individual patients with high precision of anatomic details and radiation attenuation properties. Materials and Methods: Inkjet cartridges were flled with potassium iodide solutions (600 mg/mL) and prints were realized on plain paper (80 g/m2). Stacks of 100 prints resulted in threedimensional phantoms of 1 cm thickness. In a frst step, reproduction of patient anatomy was tested by printing computed tomographic (CT) images of a real patient abdomen scan. In a second step, gray scales, iodine deposition, and Hounsfeld units were investigated by printing geometric phantoms with gray scales ranging from 0% (white) to 100% (black). On the basis of these results, a gray-scale-correction procedure was developed to achieve realistic Hounsfeld units in the patient phantom. In a third step, reproduction of the real patient's Hounsfeld units was verifed by printing the initial patient CT scan again after application of the gray-scale-correction procedure. Data were analyzed by using Pearson correlation, linear regression, and nonlinear regression. Results: The frst abdomen phantom showed a detailed reproduction of the patient anatomy and demonstrated feasibility of the concept. However, individual-organ Hounsfeld units deviated from the real patient CT scan. Analysis of the geometric phantoms revealed an exponential correlation between template gray scales and printer deposition. Application of a correction procedure to the template gray scales allowed for a linear correlation (r = 0.9946; 95% confdence interval: 0.9916, 0.9966). After the same correction procedure was applied to the abdomen phantom, linear correlation of phantom and patient Hounsfeld units was confrmed (r = 0.9925; 95% confdence interval: 0.9635, 0.9985). Conclusion: The method presented in this work can realize realistic and customizable phantoms for diagnostic and therapeutic radiology, including the reproduction of individual patients.},

Fifteen patients with left-sided breast cancer who underwent postmastectomy radiotherapy using hSDPRT were retrospectively evaluated. Two sets of planning-CT images were acquired for each patient, one with free/normal breathing and the other with DIBH. The hSDPRT plans were computed to deliver about 85% of the prescribed dose using static open fields and 15% of dose using a less complex solitary dynamic field. The dosimetric differences between the paired samples were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For clinical commissioning of gated treatments, a respiratory simulator equipped with a microcontroller was programmed to simulate free-breathing and DIBH-patterns using a custom-developed android application. While both the hSDPRT plans displayed identical target coverage on both the image-sets, the DIBH technique resulted in statistically significant differences in various dose-volume metrics of heart, left-anterior-descending artery, and ipsilateral-lung structures. The hSDPRT plan with DIBH entails reduced total monitor unit (354.9 ± 13.6 MU) and breath-hold time ranging from 2.9 ± 0.3 to 13.7 ± 0.8 seconds/field, along with an acceptable impact on overall machine throughput. DIBH is a feasible method to effectively address the delivery uncertainty and produce substantial sparing of heart and lung when combined with hSDPRT. Streamlined procedures for commissioning and calibration of DIBH-gating technique are essential for more efficient clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Physical phantoms are central to the evaluation of 2D and 3D breast-imaging systems. Currently, available physical phantoms have limitations including unrealistic uniform background structure, large expense, or excessive fabrication time. The purpose of this work is to outline a method for rapidly creating realistic, inexpensive physical anthropomorphic phantoms for use in full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Methods: The phantom was first modeled using analytical expressions and then discretized into voxels of a specified size. The interior of the breast was divided into glandular and adipose tissue classes using Voronoi segmentation, and additional structures like blood vessels, chest muscle, and ligaments were added. The physical phantom was then fabricated from the virtual model in a slice by slice fashion through inkjet printing, using parchment paper and a radiopaque ink containing 33% (I33%) or 25% (I25%) iohexol by volume. Three types of parchment paper (P1, P2, and P3) were examined. The phantom materials were characterized in terms of their effective linear attenuation coefficients (μeff) using full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and their energy-dependent linear attenuation coefficients (μ(E)) using a spectroscopic energy discriminating detector system. The printing method was further validated on the basis of accuracy, print consistency, and the reproducibility of ink batches. Results: The μeff of two types of parchment paper were close to that of adipose tissue, with μeff = 0.61 ± 0.05 cm-1 for P1, 0.61 ± 0.04 cm-1 for P2, and 0.57 ± 0.03 cm-1 for adipose tissue. The addition of the iodinated ink increased the effective attenuation to that of glandular tissue, with μeff = 0.89 ± 0.06 cm-1 for P1 + I25% and 0.94 ± 0.06 cm-1 for P1 + I33% compared to 0.90 ± 0.03 cm-1 for glandular tissue. Spectroscopic measurements showed a good match between the parchment paper and reference values for adipose and glandular tissues across photon energies. Good accuracy was found between the model and the printed phantom by comparing a FFDM of the virtual model simulated through Monte Carlo with a real FFDM of the fully printed phantom. High consistency was found over multiple prints, with 3% variability in mean ink signal across various samples. Reproducibility of ink consistency was very high with <1% variation signal from multiple batches of ink. Imaging of the phantom using FFDM and DBT systems showed promising utility for 2D and 3D imaging. Conclusions: A novel, realistic breast phantom can be created using an analytically defined breast model and readily available materials. The work provides a method to fabricate any virtual phantom in a manner that is accurate, inexpensive, easily accessible, and can be made with different materials or breast models.},

Methods and Materials One pelvis phantom and 10 patients with prostate cancer treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy were studied. To minimize the effect of organ deformation and different Hounsfield unit values between planning CT (PCT) and CBCT, we modified CBCT (mCBCT) with DIR by using the MLT (mCBCTMLT) and HM (mCBCT HM) algorithms. To evaluate the accuracy of the dose calculation, we compared dose differences in dosimetric parameters (mean dose [D mean], minimum dose [Dmin], and maximum dose [D max]) for planning target volume, rectum, and bladder between PCT (reference) and CBCTs or mCBCTs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of organ deformation compared with DIR and rigid registration (RR). We determined whether dose differences between PCT and mCBCTs were significantly lower than in CBCT by using Student t test. Results For patients, the average dose differences in all dosimetric parameters of CBCT with DIR were smaller than those of CBCT with RR (eg, rectum; 0.54% for DIR vs 1.24% for RR). For the mCBCTs with DIR, the average dose differences in all dosimetric parameters were less than 1.0%. Conclusions We evaluated the accuracy of the dose calculation in CBCT, mCBCTMLT, and mCBCTHM with DIR for 10 patients. The results showed that dose differences in Dmean, Dmin, and Dmax in mCBCTs were within 1%, which were significantly better than those in CBCT, especially for the rectum (P<.05). Our results indicate that the mCBCTMLT and mCBCTHM can be useful for improving the dose calculation for adaptive radiation therapy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To propose and evaluate online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) using in-room computed tomography (CT) imaging that detects changes in the target position and shape of the prostate and seminal vesicles (SVs) and then automatically modifies the multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf pairs in a slice-by-slice fashion. Methods and Materials: For intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using a coplanar beam arrangement, each MLC leaf pair projects onto a specific anatomic slice. The proposed strategy assumes that shape deformation is a function of only the superior-inferior (SI) position. That is, there is no shape change within a CT slice, but each slice can be displaced in the anteroposterior (AP) or right-left (RL) direction relative to adjacent slices. First, global shifts (in SI, AP, and RL directions) were calculated by three-dimensional (3D) registration of the bulk of the prostate in the treatment planning CT images with the daily CT images taken immediately before treatment. Local shifts in the AP direction were then found using slice-by-slice registration, in which the CT slices were individually registered. The translational shift within a slice could then be projected to a translational shift in the position of the corresponding MLC leaf pair for each treatment segment for each gantry angle. Global shifts in the SI direction were accounted for by moving the open portal superiorly or inferiorly by an integral number of leaf pairs. The proposed slice-by-slice registration technique was tested by using daily CT images from 46 CT image sets (23 each from 2 patients) taken before the standard delivery of IMRT for prostate cancer. A dosimetric evaluation was carried out by using an 8-field IMRT plan. Results: The shifts and shape change of the prostate and SVs could be separated into 3D global shifts in the RL, AP, and SI directions, plus local shifts in the AP direction, which were different for each CT slice. The MLC leaf positions were successfully modified to compensate for these global shifts and local shape variations. The ART method improved geometric coverage of the prostate and SVs compared with the couch-shift method, particularly for the superior part of the prostate and all the SVs, for which the interfraction shape change was the largest. The dosimetric comparison showed that the ART method covered the target better and reduced the rectal dose more than a simple couch-translation method. Conclusions: ART corrected for interfraction changes in the position and shape of the prostate and SVs and gave dose distributions that were considerably closer to the planned dose distributions than could be achieved with simple alignment strategies that neglect shape change. The ART proposed in this investigation requires neither contouring of the daily CT images nor extensive calculations; therefore, it may prove to be an effective and clinically practical solution to the problem of interfraction shape changes. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Ability of online adaptive replanning is desirable to correct for interfraction anatomic changes. A full-scope replanning/reoptimization with the current planning techniques takes too long to be practical. A novel online replanning strategy to correct for interfraction anatomic changes in real time is presented. The scheme consists of three steps: (1) rapidly delineating targets and organs at risk on the computed tomography of the day by modifying original planning contours using robust tools in a semiautomatic manner, (2) online segment aperture morphing (SAM) (adjusting beam/segment apertures) by applying the spatial relationship between the planning target contour and the apertures to the new target contour, and (3) performing segment weight optimization (SWO) for the new apertures if necessary. The entire scheme was tested for direct-aperture-based IMRT on representative prostate and abdomen cases. Dose volume histograms obtained with the online scheme are practically equivalent to those obtained with full-scope reoptimization. For the days of small to moderate organ deformations, only the SAM is necessary, while for the large deformation days, both SAM and SWO are required to adequately account for the deformation. Both the SAM and SWO programs can be completed within 1 min, and the overall process can be completed within 10 min. The proposed SAM-SWO scheme is practically comparable to full-scope reoptimization, but is fast enough to be implemented for on-line adaptive replanning, enabling dose-guided RT. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this work is to explore a new adaptive radiation therapy (ART) strategy, combined "online and offline" ART, that can fully account for interfraction variations similar to the existing online ART but with substantially reduced online effort. Methods and Materials: The concept for the combined ART is to perform online ART only for the fractions with obvious interfraction variations and to deliver the ART plan for that online fraction as well as the subsequent fractions until the next online fraction needs to be adapted. To demonstrate the idea, the daily computed tomographic (CT) data acquired during image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with an in-room CT (CTVision, Siemens Healthcare, Amarillo, TX) for 6 representative patients (including 2 prostate, 1 head-and-neck, and 1 pancreatic cancer, 1 adrenal carcinoma, and 1 craniopharyngioma patients) were analyzed. Three types of plans were generated based on the following selected daily CTs: (1) IGRT repositioning plan, generated by applying the repositioning shifts to the original plan (representing the current IGRT practice); (2) Re-Opt plan, generated with full-scope optimization; and (3) ART plan, either online ART plan generated with an online ART tool (RealArt, Prowess Inc, Concord, CA) or offline ART plan generated with shifts from the online ART plan. Various dose-volume parameters were compared with measure dosimetric benefits of the ART plans based on daily dose distributions and the cumulative dose maps obtained with deformable image registration. Results: : In general, for all the cases studied, the ART (with 3-5 online ART) and Re-Opt plans provide comparable plan quality and offer significantly better target coverage and normal tissue sparing when compared with the repositioning plans. This improvement is statistically significant. Conclusions: The combined online and offline ART is dosimetrically equivalent to the online ART but with substantially reduced online effort, and enables immediate delivery of the adaptive plan when an obvious anatomic change is observed. © 2014 American Society for Radiation Oncology.},

   abstract = {Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) has helped to dramatically reduce safety margins compensating for positioning uncertainties in radiotherapy. A remaining issue posing problems for photon radiotherapy (RT), but even more so for particle RT, is target motion during treatment delivery. This review outlines the various strategies currently being developed or already in clinical use to compensate for organ motion, predominantly breathing-induced motion of liver and lung targets. Several motion compensation strategies have recently been introduced clinically. Among these are optimized margins encompassing the individual range of target motion, treatment under breath hold, gated treatments, and tumor tracking with a dedicated treatment device. A variety of surveillance strategies for gating and tracking, such as indirect tracking with external fiducial markers and surface scanning devices, direct tracking with implanted electromagnetic markers, fiducial markers, and fluoroscopy, and ultrasound-based tracking are already in clinical use or are under development. Tracked treatment with linear accelerators based on tumor-synchronous MLC- or treatment-table adaptation are moving toward clinical use. A multitude of strategies to reduce the impact of intrafractional target motion in RT have been developed and are increasingly being used clinically. The clinical introduction of advanced strategies currently under development is imminent. After IGRT minimizesd treatment margins for static tumors, the implementation of motion compensation strategies will achieve the same for targets being subject to intrafractional breathing-induced motion. © 2012 Begell House, Inc.},

   abstract = {OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of benign intracranial lesions is well established. Its role in the treatment of benign spinal lesions is more limited. Benign spinal lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to their intracranial counterparts. In this study the authors evaluated the effectiveness of the CyberKnife for benign spinal lesions involving a single-fraction radiosurgical technique. METHODS: The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system in which an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras is coupled to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, whereby the therapy beam is guided to the intended target without the use of frame-based fixation. Cervical spine lesions were located and tracked relative to skull osseous landmarks; lower spinal lesions were tracked relative to percutaneously placed fiducial bone markers. Fifteen patients underwent single-fraction radiosurgery (12 cervical, one thoracic, and two lumbar). Histological types included neurofibroma (five cases), paraganglioma (three cases), schwannoma (two cases), meningioma (two cases), spinal chordoma (two cases), and hemangioma (one case). Radiation dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographic tumor volume with no margin. The tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 16 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 0.3 to 29.3 ml (mean 6.4 ml). Spinal canal volume receiving more than 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.9 ml (mean 0.2 ml). All patients tolerated the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation-induced toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the follow-up period. Pain improved in all patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging (mean 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: Spinal stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of benign spinal lesions. Its major potential benefits are the relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and the minimal risk of side effects. This new technique offers an alternative therapeutic modality for the treatment of a variety of benign spinal neoplasms in cases in which surgery cannot be performed, in cases with previously irradiated sites, and in cases involving lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques or as an adjunct to surgery.},

   abstract = {Radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery capabilities have changed dramatically since the introduction of three-dimensional treatment planning and are continuing to change relatively rapidly in response to the implementation of new advanced technologies. Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) is now firmly in place as the standard of practice in clinics around the world. Medical accelerator manufacturers have employed advanced computer technology to produce treatment planning/delivery systems capable of precise shaping of dose distributions via computer-controlled multileaf collimator (MLC) systems, by which the beam fluence is varied optimally to achieve the desired dose distribution. This mode of conformal therapy is referred to as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and is capable of generating dose distributions (including concave isodose volumes) that closely conform the prescription dose to the target volume and/or avoid specific sensitive normal structures. The increasing use of IMRT has focused attention on the need to better account for the intra- and inter-fraction spatial uncertainties in the dose delivery process. This has helped spur the development of treatment machines with integrated planar and volumetric advanced imaging capabilities, providing a new treatment modality referred to as image-guided IMRT (IG-IMRT), or simply image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). In addition, there is a growing interest in replacing x rays with protons because of the physical characteristics of the depth dose curve, which peaks at the end of particle range, and eventually with even heavier charged particles to take advantage of the greater density of energy deposition close to the Bragg peak and hence larger relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Three-dimensional CRT, IMRT and proton beam therapy all provide improved target coverage and lower doses to surrounding normal tissues as compared to the previously used two-dimensional radiation therapy techniques. However, this is achieved at the expense of a greater volume of normal tissue in the irradiated volume receiving some dose and a higher whole body dose (or peripheral dose) to distant normal tissues. The higher whole body dose is a result of the increased x-ray leakage radiation to the patient due to the longer beam-on times associated with IMRT, and also from neutron leakage radiation associated with high energy x-ray beams (>10 MV) and proton beams. Dose distributions for the various CRT techniques and the current status of available data for normal tissues, and whole body dose are reviewed. ©2008Health Physics Society.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Both helical tomotherapy (HT) and single-arc intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) deliver radiation using rotational beams with multileaf collimators. We report a dual-institution study comparing dosimetric aspects of these two modalities. Methods and Materials: Eight patients each were selected from the University of Maryland (UMM) and the University of Wisconsin Cancer Center Riverview (UWR), for a total of 16 cases. Four cancer sites including brain, head and neck (HN), lung, and prostate were selected. Single-arc IMAT plans were generated at UMM using Varian RapidArc (RA), and HT plans were generated at UWR using Hi-Art II TomoTherapy. All 16 cases were planned based on the identical anatomic contours, prescriptions, and planning objectives. All plans were swapped for analysis at the same time after final approval. Dose indices for targets and critical organs were compared based on dose-volume histograms, the beam-on time, monitor units, and estimated leakage dose. After the disclosure of comparison results, replanning was done for both techniques to minimize diversity in optimization focus from different operators. Results: For the 16 cases compared, the average beam-on time was 1.4 minutes for RA and 4.8 minutes for HT plans. HT provided better target dose homogeneity (7.6% for RA and 4.2% for HT) with a lower maximum dose (110% for RA and 105% for HT). Dose conformation numbers were comparable, with RA being superior to HT (0.67 vs. 0.60). The doses to normal tissues using these two techniques were comparable, with HT showing lower doses for more critical structures. After planning comparison results were exchanged, both techniques demonstrated improvements in dose distributions or treatment delivery times. Conclusions: Both techniques created highly conformal plans that met or exceeded the planning goals. The delivery time and total monitor units were lower in RA than in HT plans, whereas HT provided higher target dose uniformity. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: We aimed to examine whether stereotactic radiosurgery without whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) as the initial treatment for patients with five to ten brain metastases is non-inferior to that for patients with two to four brain metastases in terms of overall survival. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients with one to ten newly diagnosed brain metastases (largest tumour <10 mL in volume and <3 cm in longest diameter; total cumulative volume ≤15 mL) and a Karnofsky performance status score of 70 or higher from 23 facilities in Japan. Standard stereotactic radiosurgery procedures were used in all patients; tumour volumes smaller than 4 mL were irradiated with 22 Gy at the lesion periphery and those that were 4-10 mL with 20 Gy. The primary endpoint was overall survival, for which the non-inferiority margin for the comparison of outcomes in patients with two to four brain metastases with those of patients with five to ten brain metastases was set as the value of the upper 95% CI for a hazard ratio (HR) of 1·30, and all data were analysed by intention to treat. The study was finalised on Dec 31, 2012, for analysis of the primary endpoint however, monitoring of stereotactic radiosurgery-induced complications and neurocognitive function assessment will continue for the censored subset until the end of 2014. This study is registered with the University Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry, number 000001812. Findings: We enrolled 1194 eligible patients between March 1, 2009, and Feb 15, 2012. Median overall survival after stereotactic radiosurgery was 13·9 months [95% CI 12·0-15·6] in the 455 patients with one tumour, 10·8 months [9·4-12·4] in the 531 patients with two to four tumours, and 10·8 months [9·1-12·7] in the 208 patients with five to ten tumours. Overall survival did not differ between the patients with two to four tumours and those with five to ten (HR 0·97, 95% CI 0·81-1·18 [less than non-inferiority margin], p=0·78; pnon-inferiority<0·0001). Stereotactic radiosurgery-induced adverse events occurred in 101 (8%) patients; nine (2%) patients with one tumour had one or more grade 3-4 event compared with 13 (2%) patients with two to four tumours and six (3%) patients with five to ten tumours. The proportion of patients who had one or more treatment-related adverse event of any grade did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients with multiple tumours (50 [9%] patients with two to four tumours vs 18 [9%] with five to ten; p=0·89). Four patients died, mainly of complications relating to stereotactic radiosurgery (two with one tumour and one each in the other two groups). Interpretation: Our results suggest that stereotactic radiosurgery without WBRT in patients with five to ten brain metastases is non-inferior to that in patients with two to four brain metastases. Considering the minimal invasiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery and the fewer side-effects than with WBRT, stereotactic radiosurgery might be a suitable alternative for patients with up to ten brain metastases.

   abstract = {The use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been proposed for guiding the delivery of radiation therapy, and investigators have examined the use of both kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) x-ray beams in the development of such CBCT systems. In this paper, the inherent contrast and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance for a variety of existing and hypothetical detectors for CBCT are investigated analytically as a function of imaging dose and object size. Theoretical predictions are compared to the results of experimental investigations employing large-area flat-panel imagers (FPIs) at kV and MV energies. Measurements were performed on two different FPI-based CBCT systems: a bench-top prototype incorporating an FPI and kV x-ray source (100 kVp x rays), and a system incorporating an FPI mounted on the gantry of a medical linear accelerator (6 MV x rays). The SNR in volume reconstructions was measured as a function of dose and found to agree reasonably with theoretical predictions. These results confirm the theoretically predicted advantages of employing kV energy x rays in imaging soft-tissue structures found in the human body. While MV CBCT may provide a valuable means of correcting 3D setup errors and may offer an advantage in terms of simplicity of mechanical integration with a linear accelerator (e.g., implementation in place of a portal imager), kV CBCT offers significant performance advantages in terms of image contrast and SNR per unit dose for visualization of soft-tissue structures. The relatively poor SNR performance at MV energies is primarily a result of the low x-ray quantum efficiencies (a few percent or less) that are currently achieved with FPIs at high energies. Furthermore, kV CBCT with an FPI offers the potential of combined volumetric and radiographic/fluoroscopic imaging using the same device. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Geometric uncertainties in the process of radiation planning and delivery constrain dose escalation and induce normal tissue complications. An imaging system has been developed to generate high-resolution, soft-tissue images of the patient at the time of treatment for the purpose of guiding therapy and reducing such uncertainties. The performance of the imaging system is evaluated and the application to image-guided radiation therapy is discussed. Methods and Materials: A kilovoltage imaging system capable of radiography, fluoroscopy, and cone-beam computed tomography (CT) has been integrated with a medical linear accelerator. Kilovoltage X-rays are generated by a conventional X-ray tube mounted on a retractable arm at 90° to the treatment source. A 41 × 41 cm2 flat-panel X-ray detector is mounted opposite the kV tube. The entire imaging system operates under computer control, with a single application providing calibration, image acquisition, processing, and cone-beam CT reconstruction. Cone-beam CT imaging involves acquiring multiple kV radiographs as the gantry rotates through 360° of rotation. A filtered back-projection algorithm is employed to reconstruct the volumetric images. Geometric nonidealities in the rotation of the gantry system are measured and corrected during reconstruction. Qualitative evaluation of imaging performance is performed using an anthropomorphic head phantom and a coronal contrast phantom. The influence of geometric nonidealities is examined. Results: Images of the head phantom were acquired and illustrate the submillimeter spatial resolution that is achieved with the cone-beam approach. High-resolution sagittal and coronal views demonstrate nearly isotropic spatial resolution. Flex corrections on the order of 0.2 cm were required to compensate gravity-induced flex in the support arms of the source and detector, as well as slight axial movements of the entire gantry structure. Images reconstructed without flex correction suffered from loss of detail, misregistration, and streak artifacts. Reconstructions of the contrast phantom demonstrate the soft-tissue imaging capability of the system. A contrast of 47 Hounsfield units was easily detected in a 0.1-cm-thick reconstruction for an imaging exposure of 1.2 R (in-air, in absence of phantom). The comparison with a conventional CT scan of the phantom further demonstrates the spatial resolution advantages of the cone-beam CT approach. Conclusions: A kV cone-beam CT imaging system based on a large-area, flat-panel detector has been successfully adapted to a medical linear accelerator. The system is capable of producing images of soft tissue with excellent spatial resolution at acceptable imaging doses. Integration of this technology with the medical accelerator will result in an ideal platform for high-precision, image-guided radiation therapy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Early studies have demonstrated that this technique could significantly improve the therapeutic ratio by safely reducing the large target margin that has to be used in conventional radiotherapy for prostate cancer treatment. Clinical application of off-line image-guided adaptive radiotherapy for prostate cancer has demonstrated encouraging clinical outcome. Long-term clinical follow-up has shown significant improvement in terms of tumor control and low toxicity profile, emphasizing the beneficial effect of image-guidance and adaptive treatment. Continuous development in adaptive radiotherapy has made possible additional increases in target dose by further reducing target margin when using online image-guided adaptive intensity-modulated radiation therapy. However, clinical implementation of new techniques should be explored cautiously and should include a comprehensive management strategy to address uncertainties in target definition and delineation in the preclinical implementation studies. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

With the beam collimated to a fan section and just filling the detectors, the signal S(x), obtained with thickness x of plastic phantom, closely followed the relationship S(x)/S(0)=exp [â(Î±x+Î²x2)], where coefficients Î± and Î² varied systematically over the extent of the beam. This result agrees with results of similar work by others. It may be explained in terms of the spectral changes that are known to be an inherent property of such beams. Expressions relating Î± and Î² to the source spectral density are derived; also estimates of the source spectral density are calculated using the method of Laplace inversion. It is shown that scattered radiation arising from the fan beam within the scattering medium does not contribute significantly to the values of Î± and Î². © 1981, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Local control in the brain, and absent or controlled extracranial sites of disease are prerequisites for favorable survival. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a focal, highly precise treatment option with a long track record. Its clinical development and implementation by several pioneering institutions eventually rendered possible cooperative group randomized trials. A systematic review of those studies and other landmark studies was undertaken. Most clinicians are aware of the potential benefits of SRS such as a short treatment time, a high probability of treated-lesion control and, when adhering to typical dose/volume recommendations, a low normal tissue complication probability. However, SRS as sole first-line treatment carries a risk of failure in non-treated brain regions, which has resulted in controversy around when to add whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). SRS might also be prescribed as salvage treatment in patients relapsing despite previous SRS and/or WBRT. An optimal balance between intracranial control and side effects requires continued research efforts. © 2014 Nieder et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {OBJECT: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial lesions is well established. The experience with radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal and sacral lesions is more limited. Sacral lesions should be amenable to radiosurgical treatment similar to that used for their intracranial counterparts. The authors evaluated a single- fraction radiosurgical technique performed using the CyberKnife Real-Time Image-Guided Radiosurgery System for the treatment of the sacral lesion. METHODS: The CyberKnife is a frameless radiosurgery system based on the coupling of an orthogonal pair of x-ray cameras to a dynamically manipulated robot-mounted linear accelerator possessing six degrees of freedom, which guides the therapy beam to the intended target without the need for frame-based fixation. All sacral lesions were located and tracked for radiation delivery relative to fiducial bone markers placed percutaneously. Eighteen patients were treated with single-fraction radiosurgery. Tumor histology included one benign and 17 malignant tumors. Dose plans were calculated based on computerized tomography scans acquired using 1.25-mm slices. Planning treatment volume was defined as the radiographically documented tumor volume with no margin. Tumor dose was maintained at 12 to 20 Gy to the 80% isodose line (mean 15 Gy). Tumor volume ranged from 23.6 to 187.4 ml (mean 90 ml). The volume of the cauda equina receiving greater than 8 Gy ranged from 0 to 1 ml (mean 0.1 ml). All patients underwent the procedure in an outpatient setting. No acute radiation toxicity or new neurological deficits occurred during the mean follow-up period of 6 months. Pain improved in all 13 patients who were symptomatic prior to treatment. No tumor progression has been documented on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery was found to be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of both benign and malignant sacral lesions. The major potential benefits of radiosurgical ablation of sacral lesions are relatively short treatment time in an outpatient setting and minimal or no side effects. This new technique offers a new and important therapeutic modality for the primary treatment of a variety of sacral tumors or for lesions not amenable to open surgical techniques.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACTThe procedures of the radiation treatment of the cancer patient start with imaging of patient by CT machine. CT machine determine the locations and densities of patient organs in specific coordinate called pixels. Each pixel has a unit called CT number or Hounsfield Unit (HU) describing the amount of radiation attenuation in patient organ. The density of organ tissue is expressed in relative electron density (RED). The conversion relation between RED and CT number need to be measured and then transferred to the treatment planning system (TPS). The TPS calculates the radio-therapeutic dose to the patient depending on this RED-CT number conversion curve. In this research, the effect of CT x-ray tube voltage and current variations on the RED-CT number relationship are studied. Siemens CT machine of the type Somatom definition As, was used. It provides step voltages 70, 80, 100, 120, and 140 kV, with wide range of currents from 30 to 800 mA. CT RED phantom of the type CIRS 062M containing 10 tissue densities equivalent inserts was used. It was found that both CT x-ray tube voltages and currents variations have considerable effects on the RED-CT number relationships. For different CT current values, the differences between RED-CT number curves decrease when the CT voltages increase from 70 to 100 kV. At CT voltages 120 and 140 kV the differences are negligible whatever is the CT current value.},

   abstract = {Introduction For accurate dose calculations, it is necessary to provide a correct relationship between the CT numbers and electron density in radiotherapy treatment planning systems (TPSs). The purpose of this study was to investigate the energy dependence of measured CT numbers on substituted materials used for CT number calibration of radiotherapy TPSs and the resulting errors in the treatment planning calculation doses. Materials and Methods In this study, we designed a cylindrical water phantom with different materials used as tissue equivalent materials for the simulation of tissues and obtaining the related CT numbers. For evaluating the effect of CT number variations of substituted materials due to energy changing of scanner (kVp) on the dose calculation of TPS, the slices of the scanned phantom at three kVp's were imported into the desired TPSs (MIRS and CorePLAN). Dose calculations were performed on two TPSs. Results The mean absolute percentage differences between the CT numbers of CT scanner and two treatment planning systems for all the samples were 3.22%±2.57% for CorePLAN and 2.88%±2.11% for MIRS. It was also found that the maximum absolute percentage difference between all of the calculated doses from each photon beam of linac (6 and 15 MV) at three kVp's was less than 1.2%. Discussion The present study revealed that, for the materials with effective low atomic number, the mean CT number increased with increasing energy, which was opposite for the materials with an effective high atomic number. We concluded that the tissue substitute materials had a different behavior in the energy ranges from 80 to 130 kVp. So, it is necessary to consider the energy dependence of the substitute materials used for the measurement or calibration of CT number for radiotherapy treatment planning systems.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Interest in adaptive radiation therapy research is constantly growing, but software tools available for researchers are mostly either expensive, closed proprietary applications, or free open-source packages with limited scope, extensibility, reliability, or user support. To address these limitations, we propose SlicerRT, a customizable, free, and open-source radiation therapy research toolkit. SlicerRT aspires to be an open-source toolkit for RT research, providing fast computations, convenient workflows for researchers, and a general image-guided therapy infrastructure to assist clinical translation of experimental therapeutic approaches. It is a medium into which RT researchers can integrate their methods and algorithms, and conduct comparative testing. Methods: SlicerRT was implemented as an extension for the widely used 3D Slicer medical image visualization and analysis application platform. SlicerRT provides functionality specifically designed for radiation therapy research, in addition to the powerful tools that 3D Slicer offers for visualization, registration, segmentation, and data management. The feature set of SlicerRT was defined through consensus discussions with a large pool of RT researchers, including both radiation oncologists and medical physicists. The development processes used were similar to those of 3D Slicer to ensure software quality. Standardized mechanisms of 3D Slicer were applied for documentation, distribution, and user support. The testing and validation environment was configured to automatically launch a regression test upon each software change and to perform comparison with ground truth results provided by other RT applications. Results: Modules have been created for importing and loading DICOM-RT data, computing and displaying dose volume histograms, creating accumulated dose volumes, comparing dose volumes, and visualizing isodose lines and surfaces. The effectiveness of using 3D Slicer with the proposed SlicerRT extension for radiation therapy research was demonstrated on multiple use cases. Conclusions: A new open-source software toolkit has been developed for radiation therapy research. SlicerRT can import treatment plans from various sources into 3D Slicer for visualization, analysis, comparison, and processing. The provided algorithms are extensively tested and they are accessible through a convenient graphical user interface as well as a flexible application programming interface. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

Despite significant improvements in this technique over the past years, software tools for research in RT are limited to either expensive, closed, proprietary applications or heterogeneous sets of open-source software packages with limited scope, reliability, and user support. Our SlicerRT toolkit aspires to overcome these limitations by providing an extensive set of RT research tools leveraging the advanced visualization and image analysis features of its base platform 3D Slicer. The SlicerRT toolkit comprises of a set of 3D Slicer extensions: SlicerRT core, Matlab Bridge, Multi-dimensional Data, and Gel Dosimetry. The SlicerRT core extension contains 26 modules, many of which provide common RT tools used in most RT research scenarios. Matlab Bridge provides a convenient way for connecting the researchers’ existing MATLAB algorithms to the SlicerRT ecosystem. Multi-dimensional Data offers a feature set for handling multi-dimensional datasets, such as longitudinal studies or 4D data. Finally, Gel Dosimetry facilitates gel dosimetry analysis workflows through a streamlined, workflow-based end-user application. It serves as an example and proof of concept for such applications implementing advanced clinical or research workflows. Using these open-source software tools makes it possible to conduct cutting edge RT research without parallel development efforts. It acts as a medium into which researchers can integrate their methods into, and which they can use to perform comparative validation, develop novel RT techniques, or transition advanced methods into routine clinical practice.},

   abstract = {Background and aim: The practicability of computing dose calculation on cone beam CT (CBCT) has been widely investigated. In most clinical scenarios, the craniocaudal scanning length of CBCT is found to be inadequate for localization. This study aims to explore extended tomographic localization and adaptive dose calculation strategies using Hounsfield unit (HU) corrected CBCT image sets. Materials and methods: Planning CT (pCT) images of the Rando phantom (T12-to-midthigh) were acquired with pelvic-protocol using Biograph CT-scanner. Similarly, half-fan CBCT were acquired with fixed parameters using Clinac2100C/D linear accelerator integrated with an on-board imager with 2-longitudinal positions of the table. For extended localization and dose calculation, two stitching strategies viz., one with “penumbral-overlap” (S1) and the other with “no-overlap” (S2) and a local HU-correction technique were performed using custom-developed MATLAB scripts. Fluence modulated treatment plans computed on pCT were mapped with stitched CBCT and the dosimetric analyses such as dose-profile comparison, 3D-gamma (γ) evaluation and dose-volume histogram (DVH) comparison were performed. Results: Localizing scanning length of CBCT was extended by up to 15 cm and 16 cm in S1 and S2 strategies, respectively. Treatment plan mapping resulted in minor variations in the volumes of delineated structures and the beam centre co-ordinates. While the former showed maximum variations of −1.4% and −1.6%, the latter showed maximum of 1.4 mm and 2.7 mm differences in anteroposterior direction in S1 and S2 protocols, respectively. Dosimetric evaluations viz., dose profile and DVH comparisons were found to be in agreement with one another. In addition, γ-evaluation results showed superior pass-rates (≥98.5%) for both 3%/3 mm dose-difference (DD) and distance-to-agreement (DTA) and 2%/2 mm DD/DTA criteria with desirable dosimetric accuracy. Conclusion: Cone beam tomographic stitching and local HU-correction strategies developed to facilitate extended localization and dose calculation enables routine adaptive re-planning while circumventing the need for repeated pCT.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the on-board imager cone beam CT (OBI-CBCT) Hounsfield units (HUs) for treatment planning. Materials and Methods: The HU-electron density (eD) calibration for CBCT, the CATphan504 phantom was used, and the CBCT HU (HU CBCT ) consistency was studied by analyzing the CBCT images of Rando phantom and compared with planning CT. The latter study was also performed on CBCT images of 10 H&N patients. For comparison, the structures contoured and treatment plans generated on CT were transferred on to the CBCT after registration. The treatment plans were compared using gamma (g) index analysis and the plan comparison dose volume histograms (DVH PlanComp ). Results: Although the HU-eD calibration curves of both the planning CT and CBCT were found to be linear, differences in mean HU values were found in the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to Acrylic, Derlin, and Teflon, viz., 144 ± 11 HU, 193 ± 5 HU, and 257 ± 7 HU respectively. For all the cases, the consistency and reproducibility of HU CBCT values for low density medium agreed the HU CT except at regions of high density. Overall g-evaluation showed more than 94% pixels pass rate and DVH results showed small difference in the DVH PlanComp, Rando, and large differences in DVH PlanComp, patient for structures contoured at peripheral regions (PV) of CBCT images. Conclusions: We conclude that the pixel-to-pixel HU corrections for entire range of eD are not necessary for OBI-CBCT images. Application of local correction in the high-density and penumbral regions would facilitate the use of CBCT images for routine treatment planning.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To propose a “staggered overlap” technique in volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and compare the dose distribution and plan robustness with “overlap” technique and “gradient optimization” approach. Methods and Materials: 6 patients previously treated in our clinic were retrospectively selected. 9 VMAT plans of each patient were optimized with “staggered overlap”, “overlap” and “gradient optimization” in overlapping region of 3 cm, 6 cm, and 9 cm separately. For the “staggered overlap” plan, adjacent field sets were intentionally overlapped by staggering field edges in an appropriate step size to avoid sharp dose gradient. Evaluation metrics including V95%, D2%, D98%, conformity number (CN) and homogeneity index (HI) were employed to evaluate the dose distribution. Moreover, shifts of the upper spinal field isocenter in each direction were performed to simulate junction errors for robustness analysis. Results: The CN and HI of VMAT plans with “staggered overlap” were 0.82 (0.811–0.822) and 0.113 (0.112–0.114), while they were 0.778 (0.776–0.782) and 0.131 (0.130–0.131) for plans with “gradient optimization”. In the robustness study, <3% dose deviations were found for 5 mm shifts in lateral and vertical directions with all techniques. In cranial-caudal direction, “overlap” technique created hot spots (D2% > 170%) and cold spots (D98% < 44%) in the junction region with 10 mm shifts. The dose deviations were decreased to 22% for plans with “staggered overlap” and 9 cm overlapping region. Conclusion: “Staggered overlap” technique provides better plan quality as compared to “gradient optimization” approach and makes the plan more robust against junction errors as compared to “overlap” technique.},

   abstract = {Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) requires abutting fields at the cervical spine. Junction shifts are conventionally used to prevent setup error-induced overdosage/underdosage from occurring at the same location. This study compared the dosimetric differences at the cranial-spinal junction between a single-gradient junction technique and conventional multiple-junction shifts and evaluated the effect of setup errors on the dose distributions between both techniques for a treatment course and single fraction. Conventionally, 2 lateral brain fields and a posterior spine field(s) are used for CSI with weekly 1-cm junction shifts. We retrospectively replanned 4 CSI patients using a single-gradient junction between the lateral brain fields and the posterior spine field. The fields were extended to allow a minimum 3-cm field overlap. The dose gradient at the junction was achieved using dose painting and intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning. The effect of positioning setup errors on the dose distributions for both techniques was simulated by applying shifts of ± 3 and 5. mm. The resulting cervical spine doses across the field junction for both techniques were calculated and compared. Dose profiles were obtained for both a single fraction and entire treatment course to include the effects of the conventional weekly junction shifts. Compared with the conventional technique, the gradient-dose technique resulted in higher dose uniformity and conformity to the target volumes, lower organ at risk (OAR) mean and maximum doses, and diminished hot spots from systematic positioning errors over the course of treatment. Single-fraction hot and cold spots were improved for the gradient-dose technique. The single-gradient junction technique provides improved conformity, dose uniformity, diminished hot spots, lower OAR mean and maximum dose, and one plan for the entire treatment course, which reduces the potential human error associated with conventional 4-shifted plans.},

Materials and methods: Five patients from 5 institutions were treated with CSI using RapidArc technology. Patient age varied between 7 and 45 years. The lengths of the planning target volumes (PTV) and dose prescriptions ranged from 54.6 to 78.4 cm, and from 12 to 36 Gy, respectively. Different arc arrangements were used, with two or three isocentres, from two to six modulated arcs, for patient positioned either in prone (n = 3) or supine position (n = 2). Doses to PTV, organs at risk and non-target tissue are reported for each of the five patients. Data concerning imaging strategy and pre-treatment quality assurance are also reported. Results: The mean conformity index CI95% was 1.05 ± 0.05 (range: 1.00, 1.13). Mean doses to the lenses, lungs, heart, and kidneys were, respectively, 7.6 ± 1.6, 6.6 ± 3.0, 5.7 ± 2.3, and 6.1 ± 2.1 Gy, keeping those value acceptably low. Mean non-target tissue dose was 21.0 ± 3.8% (5.6 ± 1.8 Gy, range: 3.0-8.1 Gy). All patients were successfully planned and treated with RapidArc.

   abstract = {Purpose: To develop and compare a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique with conventional radiotherapy for craniospinal irradiation with respect to improved dose conformity and homogeneity in the planning target volume (PTV) and to reduced dose to organs at risk (OAR). Methods and Materials: Conventional craniospinal axis radiotherapy plans of 5 patients were acquired. The median (range) length of the PTV was 58.9 (48.1-83.7) cm. The 6-MV VMAT plans were inversely planned with one isocenter near the base of the brain and the minimum number of isocenters required for the specified lengths of spine. The plans were optimized with high weighting for PTV coverage and low weighting for OAR sparing. Conformity and heterogeneity indices, dose-volume histograms, mean doses, and non-PTV integral doses from the two plans (prescription dose 23.4 Gy in 13 fractions) were compared. Results: The median (range) conformity index of VMAT was 1.22 (1.09-1.45), compared with 1.69 (1.44-2.67) for conventional plans (p = 0.04). The median (range) heterogeneity index was also lower for VMAT compared with conventional plans: 1.04 (1.03-1.07) vs. 1.12 (1.09-1.19), respectively (p = 0.04). A significant reduction of mean and maximum doses was observed in the heart, thyroid, esophagus, optic nerves, and eyes with VMAT when compared with conventional plans. A decrease in body V 10Gy was observed, but for 4 of 5 patients non-PTV integral dose was increased with VMAT when compared with the conventional plans. Conclusions: A VMAT technique to treat the craniospinal axis significantly reduces OAR dose, potentially leading to lower late organ toxicity. However, this is achieved at the expense of increased low-dose volumes, which is inherent to the technique, carrying a potentially increased risk of secondary malignancies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {In this work a novel plan optimization platform is presented where treatment is delivered efficiently and accurately in a single dynamically modulated arc. Improvements in patient care achieved through image-guided positioning and plan adaptation have resulted in an increase in overall treatment times. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has also increased treatment time by requiring a larger number of beam directions, increased monitor units (MU), and, in the case of tomotherapy, a slice-by-slice delivery. In order to maintain a similar level of patient throughput it will be necessary to increase the efficiency of treatment delivery. The solution proposed here is a novel aperture-based algorithm for treatment plan optimization where dose is delivered during a single gantry arc of up to 360 deg. The technique is similar to tomotherapy in that a full 360 deg of beam directions are available for optimization but is fundamentally different in that the entire dose volume is delivered in a single source rotation. The new technique is referred to as volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf motion and number of MU per degree of gantry rotation is restricted during the optimization so that gantry rotation speed, leaf translation speed, and dose rate maxima do not excessively limit the delivery efficiency. During planning, investigators model continuous gantry motion by a coarse sampling of static gantry positions and fluence maps or MLC aperture shapes. The technique presented here is unique in that gantry and MLC position sampling is progressively increased throughout the optimization. Using the full gantry range will theoretically provide increased flexibility in generating highly conformal treatment plans. In practice, the additional flexibility is somewhat negated by the additional constraints placed on the amount of MLC leaf motion between gantry samples. A series of studies are performed that characterize the relationship between gantry and MLC sampling, dose modeling accuracy, and optimization time. Results show that gantry angle and MLC sample spacing as low as 1 deg and 0.5 cm, respectively, is desirable for accurate dose modeling. It is also shown that reducing the sample spacing dramatically reduces the ability of the optimization to arrive at a solution. The competing benefits of having small and large sample spacing are mutually realized using the progressive sampling technique described here. Preliminary results show that plans generated with VMAT optimization exhibit dose distributions equivalent or superior to static gantry IMRT. Timing studies have shown that the VMAT technique is well suited for on-line verification and adaptation with delivery times that are reduced to ∼1.5-3 min for a 200 cGy fraction. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Traditionally craniospinal irradiation treats the central nervous system using two or three adjacent field sets. We propose a technique using a three-isocenter intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan (jagged-junction IMRT) which overcomes problems associated with field junctions and beam edge matching and improves planning and treatment setup efficiencies with homogenous target dose distribution. Methods and Materials: Treatments for 3 patients with a prescription of 36 Gy in 20 fractions were retrospectively planned with jagged-junction IMRT and compared to conventional treatment plans. Planning target volume (PTV) included the whole brain and spinal canal to the S3 vertebral level. The plan used three field sets, each with a unique isocenter. One field set with seven fields treated the cranium. Two field sets treated the spine, each set using three fields. Fields from adjacent sets were overlapped, and the optimization process smoothly integrated the dose inside the overlapped junction. Results: For jagged-junction IMRT plans vs. conventional technique, the average homogeneity index equaled 0.08 ± 0.01 vs. 0.12 ± 0.02, respectively, and conformity number equaled 0.79 ± 0.01 vs. 0.47 ± 0.12, respectively. The 95% isodose surface covered (99.5 ± 0.3)% of the PTV vs. (98.1 ± 2.0)%, respectively. Both jagged-junction IMRT plans and the conventional plans had good sparing of organs at risk. Conclusions: Jagged-junction IMRT planning provided good dose homogeneity and conformity to the target while maintaining a low dose to organs at risk. Results from jagged-junction IMRT plans were better than or equivalent to those from the conventional technique. Jagged-junction IMRT optimization smoothly distributed dose in the junction between field sets. Because there was no beam matching, this treatment technique is less likely to produce hot or cold spots at the junction, in contrast to conventional techniques. The planning process is also simplified as only one IMRT plan is required for the entire target volume. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {used in the calculation: needle-tip positions identified directly from the ultrasound images (data1), needle-tip positions calculated from the residual needle length (data2), and using the average of the two plus a random uncertainty between 0-5 mm (data3). Treatment plans were generated based on data2 and then recalculated for other two data sets. Results: The average tip position difference between data1 and data2 for all needles from the 40 cases was 3.6 mm while maximum values can be over 10 mm because of imaging artifacts. The average prostate V100% for the original plans was 97.3%, urethra V125% was 0.31 cc, rectum V75% was 0.24 cc and bladder V75% was 0.13 cc. The prostate V100% dropped to 96.8% after recalculated using data1, the number further dropped to 95.4% using data3. Average urethra, rectum and bladder dose kept almost unchanged. New plans were generated to cover a prostate expansion of 2 mm along needle direction as the planning target. The average prostate V100% was 97.6%, urethra V125% was 0.34 cc, rectum V75% was 0.29 cc and bladder V75% was 0.22 cc. The prostate V100% was 97.3% and 97.1% by using data 1 and data3 in this approach. Conclusion: The needle-tip position errors for TRUS-based high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy can have a considerable dose impact on prostate dose coverage. A small margin along the needle direction can significantly reduce the dose coverage uncertainty while still maintain low dose level to critical structures. Purpose/Objective(s): The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) technique for CSI regarding to improving the PTV dose conformity and homogeneity with reducing the dose to organs at risk (OAR) with reporting the integral dose (ID) received by non-target tissue (NTT). Materials/Methods: A retrospective study of four male patients (nZ4) had received crainiospinal irradiation by volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT] treatment planning technique [normalized such that 95% of PTV (planning target volume) received at least 95% of the prescribed dose which is 36Gy in 20 fractions]. Plans were assessed using PTV dose coverage as D 95% (the dose received by 95% of PTV); D 2% was taken as a reference for the maximum dose and D 98% as a reference for the minimum dose, the mean doses of OARs, conformity index 95% (CI 95%), and homogeneity index (HI), and non-target tissue integral doses (NTTID). Results: VMAT CSI is able to produce satisfied dose distributions with high PTV conformity and homogeneity. The average D 95% coverage of the PTV was 34Gy, with an average conformity index 95% (CI 95%) of 0.99 and an average homogeneity index (HI) of 1.13. In terms of OAR sparing, VMAT technique allowed average mean doses acceptably low for all organs [lenses, eyes, liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart were 7.73Gy, 14.39Gy, 8.16Gy, 6.97Gy, 8.06Gy, and 8.18Gy respectively]. As regard the average integral dose for the non target tissue NTTID was 307.21Gy. Conclusion: CSI is considered one of the most challenging processes in radiotherapy. This study provides a practically useful planning method for VMAT treatment of CSI that shows its ability to achieve highly conformal and homogeneous treatment plans, while limiting the dose to the surrounding OARs. However, this technical advantage of this VMAT technique was associated with an increase in non target tissue integral dose that may be associated with increase in risk of secondary malignancies. This VMAT technique should therefore be tested with respect to late toxicity with further studies. Purpose/Objective(s): Interstitial brachytherapy is an essential component of treatment for selected gynecologic cancers, yet practice patterns suggest significant underutilization. Currently used low and high dose rate template-guided techniques require prolonged bedrest, with attendant short and long term risks. We present a novel technique utilizing Permanent Interstitial Brachytherapy (PIB) performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal toxicity and favorable early outcomes. Materials/Methods: The first 22 patients treated at our institution using a template-guided PIB implant with minimum 6 months follow-up were reviewed. Cases were pre-planned using Eclipse Brachy Planning on a dedicated CT study set, and performed under conscious sedation using a modified Syed-Neblett template that enabled ultrasound guidance. Cesium-131 sources with were placed for treatment of the bladder base (nZ4), pelvic side wall (nZ9), vaginal apex (nZ3), vulva/perineal body (nZ2), and a peri-rectal recurrence (nZ2). All patients were discharged the same day of the procedure. Patients underwent CT scanning and post-planning both immediately post procedure and again 2-3 weeks post implant. Patients were followed monthly and assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) toxicity criteria. Results: Median age was 68 years (35-86). Primary sites included cervical cancer (nZ5), vaginal cancer (nZ6), vulvar cancer (5)., An additional 6 patients were re-irradiated for recurrence of uterine (nZ5) and ovarian cancers (nZ1). Histologies included squamous (nZ16), adenocarcinoma (nZ4), serous (nZ1), and carcinosarcoma (nZ1); greater than 70% were grade 3. The median prescription dose was 25 Gy (range 15 e 55 Gy) to a median volume of 22.4 cm 3 (range 4.8 e 122.9 cm 3). A median of 9 needles were used (range 4-21), with median active length of 5 cm (range 3-10 cm), and median source strength of 1.22 u/seed (0.75 e 2.01 u/seed). The median V100 was 96.73% (range 84.3-100%). Toxicities attributable to PIB were minimal. One patient with an advanced vaginal tumor involving the rectovaginal septum developed grade 2 acute and late diarrhea attributed to the implant. Two patients definitively re-irradiated to >100 Gy cumulative to the lower 1/3 of the vagina developed grade 1 and a grade 3 soft tissue necroses, respectively. The first patient remained without symptoms, while the second required suprapubic catheter placement for severe dysuria. After a median follow-up of 7.5 month, 5 patients (22.3%) had manifest a local recurrence e 3 isolated, and 2 in combination with either regional or distant progression. Conclusion: Outpatient template-guided interstitial brachytherapy using this novel PIB technique can be completed safely and with at least equivalent outcomes to traditional interstitial brachytherapy techniques. Additional follow-up and cases will clarify long term risks and outcomes.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To report a new technique for the spinal component of craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in the supine position, to describe a verification procedure for this method, and to compare this technique with conventional plans. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients were treated between 1998 and 2006 with CSI using a novel technique. Sixteen children were treated with a conventional field arrangement. All patients were followed for outcomes and toxicity. CSI was delivered using a posteroanterior (PA) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) spinal field matched to conventional, opposed lateral cranial fields. Treatment plans were generated for each patient using the IMRT technique and a standard PA field technique. The resulting dosimetry was compared to determine target homogeneity, maximum dose to normal tissues, and total monitor units delivered. Results: Evaluation of the spinal IMRT technique compared with a standard PA technique reveals a 7% reduction in the target volume receiving ≥110% of the prescribed dose and an 8% increase in the target volume receiving ≥95% of the prescribed dose. Although target homogeneity was improved, the maximum dose delivered in the paraspinal muscles was increased by approximately 8.5% with spinal IMRT compared to the PA technique. Follow-up evaluations revealed no unexpected toxicity associated with the IMRT technique. Conclusions: A new technique of spine IMRT is presented in combination with a quality assurance method. This method improves target dose uniformity compared to the conventional CSI technique. Longer follow-up will be required to determine any benefit with regard to toxicity and disease control. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is technically very challenging and field edge matching is needed because of the mechanical limitations of standard linear accelerators. We assessed the feasibility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in CSI to overcome the standard feathering and dose inhomogeneities associated with the standard feathering technique in the junction areas. Materials and methods: The use of IMRT in CSI was studied with five patients CT scanned in the supine position. Isocentric treatment plans of three dimensional conventional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and split field IMRT (sfIMRT) with dynamic intrafractional feathering were created with the same field setup and the resulted dose distributions were compared. The effect of treatment inaccuracy was simulated with an intentional shift of ±3 mm with both treatment plans. Dosimetric verification of the sfIMRT treatment plan was performed with radiographic films placed in a phantom. Results: The sfIMRT treatment plans resulted in a better dose coverage and uniformity in the target volume. The ±3 mm shift had only a minor effect on the dose distribution of the sfIMRT treatment plan whereas with the 3D-CRT the shift resulted in an error of ±38% of the calculated dose in the spinal cord. The measured dose distribution of the sfIMRT treatment plan correlated well with the calculations. Conclusions: Improved dose homogeneity in the target volume was achieved with the sfIMRT compared to the conventional 3D-CRT treatment plan. With the sfIMRT technique only a single treatment plan is required to deliver the total treatment dose and the resulting dose distribution is also less volatile for technical uncertainties of the treatment. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   abstract = {Purpose: Craniospinal axis irradiation (CSI) is a method of treating various central nervous system malignancies. The large target volume typically includes entire spinal cord and whole brain. Dosimetric comparison was performed between tomotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) for CSI. Methods and Materials: Five (n = 5) CSI patients were planned using 3D-CRT, VMAT, and tomotherapy (normalized such that 95% of PTV received at least 23.4 Gy in 13 fractions). Plans were compared using PTV conformity number (CN) and homogeneity index (HI), normal tissue (NT) dose statistics, integral dose, and treatment time. Results: On average, tomotherapy plans showed higher CN (0.932 vs. 0.860 and 0.672 for SmartArc and 3D-CRT). In terms of HI, VMAT plans consistently showed better dose homogeneity (1.07 vs. 1.15 and 1.13 for tomotherapy and 3D-CRT). SmartArc delivered lower maximum dose for majority of NT, but higher mean dose. 3D-CRT plans delivered higher maximum dose but lower mean dose to NT. Conclusions: SmartArc treatments achieved better PTV homogeneity and reduced maximum dose to NT. Tomotherapy showed better target conformity, but 3D-CRT was shown to reduce mean dose to NT. Integral doses were similar between treatment modalities, but tomotherapy treatment times were much longer.},

   abstract = {Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) using IMRT allows dose sparing to organs-at-risk (OAR) whilst conforming the dose to the target volume. Due to the complexity of treatment involving several isocenters, the dose distribution created by the inverse-planned segmented fields must be verified prior to treatment. We propose and test methods to verify dose delivery using commonly available dosimetry equipment for commissioning and routine patient-specific dose verification of craniospinal IMRT. Ten patients treated with conventional CSI were retrospectively planned with a 3-isocenter (cranial, upper spine, and lower spine) IMRT technique. The isocenters were placed 25-27 cm away from each other in the longitudinal direction but in the same lateral and anterioposterior positions. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the brain with a 0.5 cm margin and spinal canal with a 1.0cm margin. The plans were prescribed to 36 Gy in 20 fractions to the PTV mean dose. Eleven beams (five cranial, three upper spine, and three lower spine) were optimized simultaneously. The dose delivered by the IMRT plans was then recalculated on several different phantoms and measured using the following methods: 1) ionization chamber inserted in a cylindrical phantom, positioned in the junction regions between cranial/upper-spine isocenters and upper-/lower-spine isocenters; 2) MapCHECK centered in the overlap regions; and 3) ArcCHECK measurement with beams from each isocenter. For 1) ± 3% dose difference and for 2) and 3) ≥95% of measured points with a γ-index < 1 for 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement were deemed clinically acceptable. The median (range) planned to measured dose differences for the ionization chamber is 0.4% (-1.5% to 3.0%) for the cranial/upper-spine field and 1.8% (-0.8% to 2.6%) for the upper-/lower-spine field overlap region. The median (range) percentage of MapCHECK diodes with a γ index < 1 for 3%/3 mm criterion is 98.0% (95.3% to 99.7%) for the cranial/upper-spine and 97.3% (95.0% to 99.6%) for the upper-/lower-spine field overlap regions. The median (range) percentage of ArcCHECK diodes with a γ index < 1 for 3%/3 mm criterion is 99.7% (97.1% to 100%). Three different methods of verifying craniospinal IMRT were compared and tested. All techniques offer different benefits and together can be used for 1) commissioning the treatment technique and, separately, for 2) patient-specific pretreatment verification measurements.},

   abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s): Proactive error mitigation is necessary in radiation oncology, especially for complex treatments. Few treatments are more complicated than craniospinal irradiation (CSI) which has multiple isocenters and associated field junctions, and thus, provides significant opportunities for error. We recently adopted volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to treat the entire craniospinal axis with a plan consisting of 2 or 3 isocenters with dosimetrically homogenized overlapping junctions. The goal of this study was to identify the steps in our CSI process and assess error pathways using process mapping, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), and fault tree analysis (FTA). The ultimate result was to add QA steps to mitigate the potential for error. This experience can serve as an example for others interested in applying safety engineering principles to a clinical process. Materials/Methods: The craniospinal axis was treated with 6 MV x rays on a radiation therapy system with VMAT using a 120-leaf MLC. Both body and head immobilization is used for each patient. Video surface imaging is used for initial setup, and this is followed by a series of daily cone beam CTs (CBCT) covering the brain and spine. Video surface imaging is also used to monitor intrafraction patient movement. The treatment delivery team on this project consisted of two therapists, a physicist, and a radiation oncologist. We mapped our existing process for daily treatment and identified potential errors at each step. After identifying all the failure modes, we scored the occurrence (O), severity (S), and detectability (D) of each using the 1-10 scale as described in presentations on AAPM TG-100. The product of OSD is the risk priority number (RPN) for each failure mode. Existing QA measures were considered when assigning the O and D scores. We also performed a FTA to help determine which process steps would benefit the most from QA. Results: Twenty-four process steps were identified covering patient identification, patient setup, imaging, and treatment. Occurrence, S, and D values ranged from 1-10, 2-8, and 1-4, respectively. Risk priority number values ranged from 4-144. Junction mismatch or the misapplication of image guidance were the riskiest steps and could result in spinal cord overdose. We were able to fine-tune our process and identify QA measures that could address the riskiest process steps. Total time spent by our team to perform the process mapping, FMEA and FTAwas about 54 man-hours. Conclusion: Without a systematic and deliberate focus on error pathway analysis, individuals fail to realize which process steps are riskiest. A team approach helped better identify these risks and facilitated a comprehensive and ongoing improvement of our process. This report can serve as an example to other clinics who might want to undertake such an effort.},

Two treatment plans were created for each patient, one was with the new technique called three-isocenter overlap-junction (TIOJ) IMRT and the other was with the three-isocenter jagged-junction (TIJJ) IMRT technique. The comparative study was conducted using the parameters of heterogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), and doses to the organs at risk (OARs).Results: Comparing the TIOJ IMRT plans with the TIJJ IMRT plans, the average homogeneity index is 0.071 ± 0.003 and 0.077 ± 0.002, respectively, and the averaged conformity number is 0.80 ± 0.012 and 0.80 ± 0.009, respectively. There are no significant differences (p > 0.05). Both plans provide satisfactory sparing for the OARs.Conclusions: The TIOJ IMRT technique for CSI treatment planning can create similar plans as with the TIJJ IMRT technique, but the new technique greatly simplifies the steps required to manually set field widths and boundaries and improved efficiency. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Respiratory-gated radiotherapy offers a significant potential for improvement in the irradiation of tumor sites affected by respiratory motion such as lung, breast, and liver tumors. An increased conformality of irradiation fields leading to decreased complication rates of organs at risk is expected. Five main strategies are used to reduce respiratory motion effects: integration of respiratory movements into treatment planning, forced shallow breathing with abdominal compression, breath-hold techniques, respiratory gating techniques, and tracking techniques. Measurements of respiratory movements can be performed either in a representative sample of the general population, or directly on the patient before irradiation. Reduction of breathing motion can be achieved by using either abdominal compression, breath-hold techniques, or respiratory gating techniques. Abdominal compression can be used to reduce diaphragmatic excursions. Breath-hold can be achieved with active techniques, in which airflow of the patient is temporarily blocked by a valve, or passive techniques, in which the patient voluntarily breath-holds. Respiratory gating techniques use external devices to predict the phase of the breathing cycle while the patient breathes freely. Another approach is tumor-tracking technique, which consists of a real-time localization of a constantly moving tumor. This work describes these different strategies and gives an overview of the literature.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Background: Functional upper extremity (UE) motion enables humans to execute activities of daily living (ADLs). There currently exists no universal language to systematically characterize this type of motion or its fundamental building blocks, called primitives. Without a standardized classification approach, pooling mechanistic knowledge and unpacking rehabilitation content will remain challenging. Methods: We created a taxonomy to characterize functional UE motions occurring during ADLs, classifying them by motion presence, temporal cyclicity, upper body effector, and contact type. We identified five functional primitives by their phenotype and purpose: reach, reposition, transport, stabilize, and idle. The taxonomy was assessed for its validity and interrater reliability in right-paretic chronic stroke patients performing a selection of ADL tasks. We applied the taxonomy to identify the primitive content and motion characteristics of these tasks, and to evaluate the influence of impairment level on these outcomes. Results: The taxonomy could account for all motions in the sampled activities. Interrater reliability was high for primitive identification (Cohen's kappa = 0.95-0.99). Using the taxonomy, the ADL tasks were found to be composed primarily of transport and stabilize primitives mainly executed with discrete, proximal motions. Compared to mildly impaired patients, moderately Provis impaired patients used more repeated reaches and axial-proximal UE motion to execute the tasks. Conclusions: The proposed taxonomy yields objective, quantitative data on human functional UE motion. This new method could facilitate the decomposition and quantification of UE rehabilitation, the characterization of functional abnormality after stroke, and the mechanistic examination of shared behavior in motor studies.},

   abstract = {Physiology is a set of processes that maintain homeostasis, and physiological measurement is a means of observing these processes. Systems theory and signal processing offer formal tools for the study of processes and measured quantities. This book shows that systems modeling can be used to develop simulations of physiological systems, which use formal relations between the underlying processes and the observed measurements. The inverse of such relations suggest signal processing tools that can be applied to interpret experimental data. Both signal processing and systems modeling are invaluable in the study of human physiology. Discussing signal processing techniques ranging from filtering and spectrum analysis to wavelet analysis, the book uses graphs and analogies to supplement the mathematics and make the book more accessible to physiologists and more interesting to engineers. Physiological systems modeling helps in both gaining insight and generating methods of analysis. This book shows how numerical computation with graphical display, haptics and multimedia can be used to simulate physiological systems. In this third edition the simulations are more closely related to clinical examination and experimental physiology than in previous editions. Detailed models of nerve and muscle at the cellular and systemic levels, and simplified models of cardiovascular blood flow provide examples for the mathematical methods and computer simulations. Several of the models are sufficiently sophisticated to be of value in understanding real world issues like neuromuscular disease. The book features expanded problem sets and a link to extra downloadable material containing simulation programs that are solutions to the theory developed in the text.},

   abstract = {The methods combining correlation filters (CFs) with the features of convolutional neural network (CNN) are good at object tracking. However, the high-level features of a typical CNN without residual structure suffer from the shortage of fine-grained information, it is easily affected by similar objects or background noise. Meanwhile, CF-based methods usually update filters at every frame even when occlusion occurs, which degrades the capability of discriminating the target from background. A novel scale-adaptive object-tracking method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the features are extracted from different layers of ResNet to produce response maps, and then, in order to locate the target more accurately, these response maps are fused based on AdaBoost algorithm. Secondly, to prevent the filters from updating when occlusion occurs, an update strategy with occlusion detection is proposed. Finally, a scale filter is used to estimate the target scale. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably compared with several mainstream methods especially in the case of occlusion and scale change.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To present and evaluate a straightforward implementation of a marker-less, respiratory motion-tracking process utilizing Kinect v2 camera as a gating tool during 4DCT or during radiotherapy treatments. Methods: Utilizing the depth sensor on the Kinect as well as author written C# code, respiratory motion of a subject was tracked by recording depth values obtained at user selected points on the subject, with each point representing one pixel on the depth image. As a patient breathes, specific anatomical points on the chest/abdomen will move slightly within the depth image across pixels. By tracking how depth values change for a specific pixel, instead of how the anatomical point moves throughout the image, a respiratory trace can be obtained based on changing depth values of the selected pixel. Tracking these values was implemented via marker-less setup. Varian's RPM system and the Anzai belt system were used in tandem with the Kinect to compare respiratory traces obtained by each using two different subjects. Results: Analysis of the depth information from the Kinect for purposes of phase- and amplitude-based binning correlated well with the RPM and Anzai systems. Interquartile Range (IQR) values were obtained comparing times correlated with specific amplitude and phase percentages against each product. The IQR time spans indicated the Kinect would measure specific percentage values within 0.077 s for Subject 1 and 0.164 s for Subject 2 when compared to values obtained with RPM or Anzai. For 4DCT scans, these times correlate to less than 1 mm of couch movement and would create an offset of 1/2 an acquired slice. Conclusion: By tracking depth values of user selected pixels within the depth image, rather than tracking specific anatomical locations, respiratory motion can be tracked and visualized utilizing the Kinect with results comparable to that of the Varian RPM and Anzai belt.},

With the release of the Kinect v2 a new promising device is available, which will – most probably – be used in many future research. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of the Kinect v1 and Kinect v2. We investigate the accuracy and precision of the devices for their usage in the context of 3D reconstruction, SLAM or visual odometry. For each device we rigorously figure out and quantify influencing factors on the depth images like temperature, the distance of the camera or the scene color. Furthermore, we demonstrate errors like flying pixels and multipath interference. Our insights build the basis for incorporating or modeling the errors of the devices in follow-up algorithms for diverse applications.},

Human joints reconstructed from non-standard poses such as squatting, sitting and lying are asymmetric and have unnatural lengths while their recognition error exceeds the error of recognizing standard poses. In order to achieve higher accuracy and usability for practical smart health applications we propose a practical solution for human skeleton tracking and analysis that performs the fusion of skeletal data from three Kinect devices to provide a complete 3D spatial coverage of a subject. The paper describes a novel data fusion algorithm using algebraic operations in vector space, the deployment of the system using three Kinect units, provides analysis of dynamic characteristics (position of joints, speed of movement, functional working envelope, body asymmetry and the rate of fatigue) of human motion during physical exercising, and evaluates intra-session reliability of the system using test–retest reliability metrics (intra-class correlation, coefficient of variation and coefficient of determination). Comparison of multi-Kinect system vs single-Kinect system shows an improvement in accuracy of 15.7%, while intra-session reliability is rated as excellent.},

   abstract = {Kinect sensors are able to achieve considerable skeleton tracking performance in a convenient and low-cost manner. However, Kinect sensors often generate poor skeleton poses due to self-occlusion, which is a common problem among most vision-based sensing systems. A simple way to solve this problem is to use multiple Kinect sensors in a workspace and combine the measurements from the different sensors. However, this method creates a new issue known as the data fusion problem. In this research, we developed a human skeleton tracking system using the Kalman filter framework, in which multiple Kinect sensors are used to correct inaccurate tracking data from a single Kinect sensor. Our contribution is to propose a method to determine the reliability of each tracked 3D position of a joint and then combine multiple observations based on measurement confidence. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparison with the ground truth obtained using a commercial marker-based motion-capture system.},

   abstract = {The ultimate goal of any upper-limb neurorehabilitation procedure is to improve upper-limb functioning in daily life. While clinic-based assessments provide an assessment of what a patient can do, they do not completely reflect what a patient does in his/her daily life. The use of compensatory strategies such as the use of the less affected upper-limb or excessive use of trunk in daily life is a common behavioral pattern seen in patients with hemiparesis. To this end, there has been an increasing interest in the use of wearable sensors to more objectively assess upper-limb functioning. This paper presents a framework for assessing upper-limb functioning using sensors by providing: (a) a set of definitions of important constructs associated with upper-limb functioning; (b) different visualization methods for evaluating upper-limb functioning; and (c) two new measures for quantifying how much an upper-limb is used and the relative bias in their use. The demonstration of some of these components is presented using data collected from inertial measurement units from a previous study. The proposed framework can help guide the future technical and clinical work in this area to realize valid, objective, and robust tools for assessing upper-limb functioning. This will, in turn, drive the refinement and standardization of the assessment of upper-limb functioning.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose - Differences exist between European countries in the proportion of patients who die or become dependent after stroke. The aim of the present study was to identify differences in the use of time by stroke patients in 4 rehabilitation centers in 4 European countries. Methods - In each of the 4 centers, 60 randomly selected stroke patients were observed at 10-minute intervals using behavioral mapping. Observations took place on 30 weekdays selected at random, on equal numbers of morning, afternoon, and evening sessions. A logistic generalized estimating equation model with correction for differences in case mix and multiple testing was used for the analysis. Results - Overall time available from different professions was the highest in the United Kingdom, but patients in the United Kingdom spent on average only 1 hour per day in therapy. This was significantly less than patients in Belgium and Germany, who spent ≈2 hours, and patients in Switzerland who spent ≈3 hours per day in therapy. In all centers, patients spent less than half their time in interactions and >72% of the time in nontherapeutic activities. Conclusions - Important differences in the use of time were established, which appeared dependent on management decisions rather than the number of staff available. Patients in the Swiss and German centers spent more time in therapy, possibly because of the structured organization of rehabilitation. Further studies will verify whether this has an effect on outcome. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Loss of arm-hand performance due to a hemiparesis as a result of stroke or cerebral palsy (CP), leads to large problems in daily life of these patients. Assessment of arm-hand performance is important in both clinical practice and research. To gain more insight in e.g. effectiveness of common therapies for different patient populations with similar clinical characteristics, consensus regarding the choice and use of outcome measures is paramount. To guide this choice, an overview of available instruments is necessary. The aim of this systematic review is to identify, evaluate and categorize instruments, reported to be valid and reliable, assessing arm-hand performance at the ICF activity level in patients with stroke or cerebral palsy.Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify articles containing instruments assessing arm-hand skilled performance in patients with stroke or cerebral palsy. Instruments were identified and divided into the categories capacity, perceived performance and actual performance. A second search was performed to obtain information on their content and psychometrics.Results: Regarding capacity, perceived performance and actual performance, 18, 9 and 3 instruments were included respectively. Only 3 of all included instruments were used and tested in both patient populations. The content of the instruments differed widely regarding the ICF levels measured, assessment of the amount of use versus the quality of use, the inclusion of unimanual and/or bimanual tasks and the inclusion of basic and/or extended tasks.Conclusions: Although many instruments assess capacity and perceived performance, a dearth exists of instruments assessing actual performance. In addition, instruments appropriate for more than one patient population are sparse. For actual performance, new instruments have to be developed, with specific focus on the usability in different patient populations and the assessment of quality of use as well as amount of use. Also, consensus about the choice and use of instruments within and across populations is needed. © 2012 Lemmens et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: Wrist-worn accelerometry provides objective monitoring of upper-extremity functional use, such as reaching tasks, but also detects nonfunctional movements, leading to ambiguity in monitoring results. Objective: Compare machine learning algorithms with standard methods (counts ratio) to improve accuracy in detecting functional activity. Methods: Healthy controls and individuals with stroke performed unstructured tasks in a simulated community environment (Test duration = 26 ± 8 minutes) while accelerometry and video were synchronously recorded. Human annotators scored each frame of the video as being functional or nonfunctional activity, providing ground truth. Several machine learning algorithms were developed to separate functional from nonfunctional activity in the accelerometer data. We also calculated the counts ratio, which uses a thresholding scheme to calculate the duration of activity in the paretic limb normalized by the less-affected limb. Results: The counts ratio was not significantly correlated with ground truth and had large errors (r = 0.48; P =.16; average error = 52.7%) because of high levels of nonfunctional movement in the paretic limb. Counts did not increase with increased functional movement. The best-performing intrasubject machine learning algorithm had an accuracy of 92.6% in the paretic limb of stroke patients, and the correlation with ground truth was r = 0.99 (P <.001; average error = 3.9%). The best intersubject model had an accuracy of 74.2% and a correlation of r =0.81 (P =.005; average error = 5.2%) with ground truth. Conclusions: In our sample, the counts ratio did not accurately reflect functional activity. Machine learning algorithms were more accurate, and future work should focus on the development of a clinical tool.},

   abstract = {The arising of domestic robots in smart infrastructure has raised demands for intuitive and natural interaction between humans and robots. To address this problem, a wearable wrist-worn camera (WwwCam) is proposed in this paper. With the capability of recognizing human hand gestures in real-time, it enables services such as controlling mopping robots, mobile manipulators, or appliances in smart-home scenarios. The recognition is based on finger segmentation and template matching. Distance transformation algorithm is adopted and adapted to robustly segment fingers from the hand. Based on fingers' angles relative to the wrist, a finger angle prediction algorithm and a template matching metric are proposed. All possible gesture types of the captured image are first predicted, and then evaluated and compared to the template image to achieve the classification. Unlike other template matching methods relying highly on large training set, this scheme possesses high flexibility since it requires only one image as the template, and can classify gestures formed by different combinations of fingers. In the experiment, it successfully recognized ten finger gestures from number zero to nine defined by American Sign Language with an accuracy up to 99.38%. Its performance was further demonstrated by manipulating a robot arm using the implemented algorithms and WwwCam to transport and pile up wooden building blocks.},

   abstract = {Approaches to the rehabilitation of movement in spastic hemiparetic patients depend on knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of movement deficits. The goals of this study were to characterize end-point trajectories and interjoint coordination of arm pointing movements to different targets on a horizontal planar surface and to correlate disruptions in motor control in the affected arm of hemiparetic subjects with the level of spasticity and the degree of functional impairment measured clinically Aim movements were studied in six normal and 10 hemiparetic subjects. Data from the affected arms of hemiparetic subjects were compared with those from their non-affected arms and to data from the arms of normal subjects. Subjects were seated in front of a horizontal surface adjusted to the height of the sternal notch with the trunk stabilized. They made planar arm reaching movements (20 and 40 cm) to four different targets located directly in front of them and in the ipsilateral and contralateral workspace. Kinematic data from the finger wrist, elbow and shoulder were recorded with a three dimensional optical tracking system. Results showed that movement amplitudes were lower and movement times were significantly prolonged in the affected arms. Although trajectories were marked by deviations from smooth straight lines and characterized by increased dispersion and segmentation, even those subjects with the most severe spasticity could reach into all parts of the workspace with both their affected and non-affected arms. This indicated that movement planning in terms of extrapersonal space was unaffected in these subjects. On the other hand, the interjoint coordination of movements made into or out of the typical extensor or flexor synergies was equally disrupted. These findings suggest a bi-level control organization of pointing movements in both normal and hemipareric subjects: the level of trajectory planning in extrapersonal space and the level specifying interjoint coordination according to the trajectory plan. Deficits in motor performance in stroke patients may be associated with problems at the second control level. This implies some strategies for the rehabilitation of stroke patients with motor disorders. Treatment aimed at improving arm function should be oriented toward restoring the normal sensorimotor relationships between the joints. We also found that while clinical spasticity scores were correlated with some aspects of motorperformance, they provided little information about the movement deficit itself},

   abstract = {Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are increasingly used to estimate movement quality and quantity to the infer the nature of motor behavior. The current literature contains several attempts to estimate movement smoothness using data from IMUs, many of which assume that the translational and rotational kinematics measured by IMUs can be directly used with the smoothness measures spectral arc length (SPARC) and log dimensionless jerk (LDLJ-V). However, there has been no investigation of the validity of these approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the use of these measures on the kinematics measured by IMUs. We show that: (a) SPARC and LDLJ-V are valid measures of smoothness only when used with velocity; (b) SPARC and LDLJ-V applied on translational velocity reconstructed from IMU is highly error prone due to drift caused by integration of reconstruction errors; (c) SPARC can be applied directly on rotational velocities measured by a gyroscope, but LDLJ-V can be error prone. For discrete translational movements, we propose a modified version of the LDLJ-V measure, which can be applied to acceleration data (LDLJ-A). We evaluate the performance of these measures using simulated and experimental data. We demonstrate that the accuracy of LDLJ-A depends on the time profile of IMU orientation reconstruction error. Finally, we provide recommendations for how to appropriately apply these measures in practice under different scenarios, and highlight various factors to be aware of when performing smoothness analysis using IMU data.},

   abstract = {Background. Although inpatient rehabilitation may enhance an individual's functional ability after stroke, it is not known whether these improvements are accompanied by an increase in daily use of the arms and legs. Objectives. To determine the change in daily use of the upper and lower extremities of stroke patients during rehabilitation and to compare these values with that of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. A total of 60 stroke patients underwent functional assessments and also wore 3 accelerometers for 3 consecutive weekdays on admission to rehabilitation and 3 weeks later prior to hospital discharge. The number of steps and upper-extremity activity counts were measured over the waking hours and during daily use for occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) sessions. Healthy older adults (n = 40) also wore 3 accelerometers for 5 consecutive days. Results. Stroke patients demonstrated a significant increase in mobility function, and this was accompanied by an increase in daily walking over the entire day as well as in PT. However, increases in daily walking were found predominantly in patients who were wheelchair users (and not walkers) at the time of admission. Control walking values (5202 steps) were more than 17 times that of stroke patients. Despite significant improvements in paretic hand function, no increase in daily use of the paretic or nonparetic hand was found over the entire day or in PT. Conclusions. A disparity between functional recovery and increases in daily use of the upper and lower extremities was found during inpatient stroke rehabilitation. © American Society of Neurorehabilitation 2012.},

   abstract = {The "learned non-use phenomenon" described by Taub, one of the most original recent contributions to rehabilitation medicine probably corresponds to what Henry Meige (1866-1940), who studied under J.-M. Charcot, described in hemiplegics in 1904 using the expression "functional motor amnesia". He specified in 1914 at the time of the Babinski description of anosognosia, that: "Even with educated subjects who are still relatively young we are sometimes confronted with strange incapacities that are not due to impotence, negligence, or lack of confidence in the results. [...] With the transitory halting of the motility all memory of the function appears to have disappeared". Meige describes motor disorders that are: (i) distinct from lesional paralyses; (ii) secondary to the absence of activity; (iii) linked to a learning process; (iv) linked to a phenomenon of functional memory loss; (v) reversible; and (vi) motor re-education focusing on extended and repeated practice of the lost function: the same characteristics as the "phenomenon of learned non-use" described by Taub in monkeys then in man. © 2004 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Quantitative measures of smoothness play an important role in the assessment of sensorimotor impairment and motor learning. Traditionally, movement smoothness has been computed mainly for discrete movements, in particular arm, reaching and circle drawing, using kinematic data. There are currently very few studies investigating smoothness of rhythmic movements, and there is no systematic way of analysing the smoothness of such movements. There is also very little work on the smoothness of other movement related variables such as force, impedance etc. In this context, this paper presents the first step towards a unified framework for the analysis of smoothness of arbitrary movements and using various data. It starts with a systematic definition of movement smoothness and the different factors that influence smoothness, followed by a review of existing methods for quantifying the smoothness of discrete movements. A method is then introduced to analyse the smoothness of rhythmic movements by generalising the techniques developed for discrete movements. We finally propose recommendations for analysing smoothness of any general sensorimotor behaviour.},

However, the most widely established method, based on activity counts, provides quantitative rather than qualitative information on arm without functional insights, and is sensitive to passive arm movements during ambulatory activities. We propose a method to quantify functionally relevant arm use in stroke survivors relying on a single wrist-worn inertial measurement unit. Orientation of the forearm during movements is measured in order identify gross arm movements. The method is validated in 10 subacute/chronic stroke survivors wearing inertial sensors at 5 anatomical locations for 48 h. Measurements are compared to conventional activity counts and to a test for gross manual dexterity. Duration of gross arm movements of the paretic arm correlated significantly better with the Box and Block Test (r= 0.95) than conventional activity counts when walking phases were included (r= 0.69), and similar results were found when comparing ratios of paretic and non-paretic arms for gross movements and activity counts. The proposed gross arm movement metric is robust against passive arm movements during ambulatory activities and requires only a single-sensor module placed at the paretic wrist for the assessment of functionally relevant arm use.},

   abstract = {A key reason for referral to rehabilitation services after stroke and other neurological conditions is to improve one's ability to function in daily life. It has become important to measure a person's activities in daily life, and not just measure their capacity for activity in the structured environment of a clinic or laboratory. A wearable sensor that is now enabling measurement of daily movement is the accelerometer. Accelerometers are commercially-available devices resembling large wrist watches that can be worn throughout the day. Data from accelerometers can quantify how the limbs are engaged to perform activities in peoples' homes and communities. This report describes a methodology to collect accelerometry data and turn it into clinically-relevant information. First, data are collected by having the participant wear two accelerometers (one on each wrist) for 24 h or longer. The accelerometry data are then downloaded and processed to produce four different variables that describe key aspects of upper limb activity in daily life: hours of use, use ratio, magnitude ratio, and the bilateral magnitude. Density plots can be constructed that visually represent the data from the 24 h wearing period. The variables and their resultant density plots are highly consistent in neurologically-intact, community-dwelling adults. This striking consistency makes them a useful tool for determining if upper limb daily performance is different from normal. This methodology is appropriate for research studies investigating upper limb dysfunction and interventions designed to improve upper limb performance in daily life in people with stroke and other patient populations. Because of its relative simplicity, it may not be long before it is also incorporated in clinical neurorehabilitation practice.},

   abstract = {A technique is described that characterizes the dynamics of the interjoint coordination of arm reaching movements in healthy subjects (n=10) and in patients who had sustained a left-sided cerebrovascular accident (n=18). All participants were right-handed. Data from the affected right arm of patients with stroke were compared with those from the right arm of healthy subjects. Seated subjects made 25 pointing movements in a single session. Movements were made from an initial target located ipsilaterally to the right arm beside the body, to a final target located in front of the subject in the contralateral arm workspace. Kinematic data from the finger, wrist, elbow, both shoulders and sternum were recorded in three dimensions at 200 Hz with an optical tracking system. Analysis of interjoint coordination was based on the patterns of temporal delay between rotations at two adjacent joints (shoulder and elbow). The data were reduced to a single graph (Temporal Coordination or TC index) integrating the essential temporal characteristics of joint movement (the angular displacements, velocities and timing). TC segments, duration and amplitude, were analysed. The analysis was sensitive to the differences in interjoint coordination between healthy subjects and patients with arm motor deficits. In patients, the temporal coordination between elbow and shoulder movements was disrupted from the middle to the end of the reach. More specifically, in mid-reach, all patients had difficulty coordinating elbow flexion with shoulder horizontal adduction. In addition, patients with severe arm hemiparesis had difficulty changing elbow movement direction from flexion to extension and in coordinating this change with shoulder movement. At the end of the reach, patients with severe hemiparesis had deficits in the execution of elbow extension while all patients had impaired coordination of elbow extension and shoulder horizontal adduction. In addition, active ranges of joint motions were significantly decreased in the stroke compared to the healthy subjects. Finally, TC analysis revealed significant relationships between specific aspects of disrupted interjoint coordination and the level of motor impairment, suggesting that it may be a useful tool in the identification of specific movement coordination deficits in neurological impaired populations that can be targeted in treatment for arm motor recovery.},

The European research project INTERACTION (FP7-ICT-2011-7-287351) evaluated motor capabilities in stroke patients during the recovery treatment period. We developed wearable sensing platform based on the sensor fusion among inertial, knitted piezoresistive sensors and textile EMG electrodes. The device was conceived in modular form and consists of a separate shirt, trousers, glove, and shoe. Thanks to the novel fusion approach it has been possible to develop a model for the shoulder taking into account the scapulo-thoracic joint of the scapular girdle, considerably improving the estimation of the hand position in reaching activities. In order to minimize the sensor set used to monitor gait, a single inertial sensor fused with a textile goniometer proved to reconstruct the orientation of all the body segments of the leg. Finally, the sensing glove, endowed with three textile goniometers and three force sensors showed good capabilities in the reconstruction of grasping activities and evaluating the interaction of the hand with the environment, according to the project specifications. This paper reports on the design and the technical evaluation of the performance of the sensing platform, tested on healthy subjects.},

Here, we introduce a method for mapping an animal's actions, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviours.

These include multiple modes of locomotion and grooming. We use the resulting measurements as the basis for identifying subtle sex-specific behavioural differences and revealing the low-dimensional nature of animal motions..},

   abstract = {Background: Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with upper limb deficits affecting an estimated 30% to 60% of survivors. The effectiveness of upper limb rehabilitation relies on numerous factors, particularly patient compliance to home programs and exercises set by therapists. However, therapists lack objective information about their patients’ adherence to rehabilitation exercises as well as other uses of the affected arm and hand in everyday life outside the clinic. We developed a system that consists of wearable sensor technology to monitor a patient’s arm movement and a Web-based dashboard to visualize this information for therapists. Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate how therapists use upper limb movement information visualized on a dashboard to support the rehabilitation process. Methods: An interactive dashboard prototype with simulated movement information was created and evaluated through a user-centered design process with therapists (N=8) at a rehabilitation clinic. Data were collected through observations of therapists interacting with an interactive dashboard prototype, think-aloud data, and interviews. Data were analyzed qualitatively through thematic analysis. Results: Therapists use visualizations of upper limb information in the following ways: (1) to obtain objective data of patients’ activity levels, exercise, and neglect outside the clinic, (2) to engage patients in the rehabilitation process through education, motivation, and discussion of experiences with activities of daily living, and (3) to engage with other clinicians and researchers based on objective data. A major limitation is the lack of contextual data, which is needed by therapists to discern how movement data visualized on the dashboard relate to activities of daily living. Conclusions: Upper limb information captured through wearable devices provides novel insights for therapists and helps to engage patients and other clinicians in therapy. Consideration needs to be given to the collection and visualization of contextual information to provide meaningful insights into patient engagement in activities of daily living. These findings open the door for further work to develop a fully functioning system and to trial it with patients and clinicians during therapy. [JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol 2016;3(2):e9]},

   abstract = {Background: The most popular method for measuring upper limb activity is based on accelerometery. However, this method is prone to overestimation and is agnostic to the functional utility of a movement. In this study, we used an inertial measurement unit(IMU)-based gross movement score to quantify arm-use in hemiparetic patients at home. Objectives: (i) Validate the gross movement score detected by wrist-worn IMUs against functional movements identified by human assessors. (ii) Test the feasibility of using wrist-worn IMUs to measure arm-use in patients' natural settings. Methods: To validate the gross movement score two independent assessors analyzed and annotated the video recordings of 5 hemiparetic patients and 10 healthy controls performing a set of activities while wearing IMUs. The second study tracked arm-use of 5 hemiparetic patients and 5 healthy controls using two wrist-worn IMUs for 7 days and 3 days, respectively. The IMU data obtained from this study was used to develop quantitative measures (total and relative arm-use (RAU)) and a visualization method for arm-use. Results: The gross movement score detects functional movement with 50-60% accuracy in hemiparetic patients, and is robust to non-functional movements. Healthy controls showed a slight bias towards the dominant arm (RAU: 40.52º). Patients' RAU varied between 15-47º depending upon their impairment level and pre-stroke hand dominance. Conclusions: The gross movement score performs moderately well in detecting functional movements while rejecting non-functional movements. The patients' total arm-use is less than healthy controls, and their relative arm-use is skewed towards the less-impaired arm.},

   abstract = {Background: The use of both upper extremities (UE) is necessary for the completion of many everyday tasks. Few clinical assessments measure the abilities of the UEs to work together; rather, they assess unilateral function and compare it between affected and unaffected UEs. Furthermore, clinical assessments are unable to measure function that occurs in the real-world, outside the clinic. This study examines the validity of an innovative approach to assess real-world bilateral UE activity using accelerometry. Methods: Seventy-four neurologically intact adults completed ten tasks (donning/doffing shoes, grooming, stacking boxes, cutting playdough, folding towels, writing, unilateral sorting, bilateral sorting, unilateral typing, and bilateral typing) while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Two variables, the Bilateral Magnitude and Magnitude Ratio, were derived from accelerometry data to distinguish between high- and low-intensity tasks, and between bilateral and unilateral tasks. Estimated energy expenditure and time spent in simultaneous UE activity for each task were also calculated. Results: The Bilateral Magnitude distinguished between high- and low-intensity tasks, and the Magnitude Ratio distinguished between unilateral and bilateral UE tasks. The Bilateral Magnitude was strongly correlated with estimated energy expenditure (ρ = 0.74, p<0.02), and the Magnitude Ratio was strongly correlated with time spent in simultaneous UE activity (ρ = 0.93, p<0.01) across tasks. Conclusions: These results demonstrate face validity and construct validity of this methodology to quantify bilateral UE activity during the performance of everyday tasks performed in a laboratory setting, and can now be used to assess bilateral UE activity in real-world environments. © 2014 Bailey et al.},

Recently, wearable cameras have begun to be exploited. This paper presents a review of the state of the art of egocentric vision systems for the recognition of ADLs following a hierarchical structure: motion, action and activity levels, where each level provides higher semantic information and involves a longer time frame. The current egocentric vision literature suggests that ADLs recognition is mainly driven by the objects present in the scene, especially those associated with specific tasks. However, although object-based approaches have proven popular, object recognition remains a challenge due to the intra-class variations found in unconstrained scenarios. As a consequence, the performance of current systems is far from satisfactory.},

   abstract = {Objective: Current clinical biomechanics involves lengthy data acquisition and time-consuming offline analyses with biomechanical models not operating in real-time for man-machine interfacing. We developed a method that enables online analysis of neuromusculoskeletal function in vivo in the intact human. Methods: We used electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling to simulate all transformations from muscle excitation onset (EMGs) to mechanical moment production around multiple lower-limb degrees of freedom (DOFs). We developed a calibration algorithm that enables adjusting musculoskeletal model parameters specifically to an individual's anthropometry and force-generating capacity. We incorporated the modeling paradigm into a computationally efficient, generic framework that can be interfaced in real-time with any movement data collection system. Results: The framework demonstrated the ability of computing forces in 13 lower-limb muscle-tendon units and resulting moments about three joint DOFs simultaneously in real-time. Remarkably, it was capable of extrapolating beyond calibration conditions, i.e., predicting accurate joint moments during six unseen tasks and one unseen DOF. Conclusion: The proposed framework can dramatically reduce evaluation latency in current clinical biomechanics and open up new avenues for establishing prompt and personalized treatments, as well as for establishing natural interfaces between patients and rehabilitation systems. Significance: The integration of EMG with numerical modeling will enable simulating realistic neuromuscular strategies in conditions including muscular/orthopedic deficit, which could not be robustly simulated via pure modeling formulations. This will enable translation to clinical settings and development of healthcare technologies including real-time bio-feedback of internal mechanical forces and direct patient-machine interfacing.},

   abstract = {Objective. To investigate the test-retest reproducibility and smallest real difference (SRD) of 3 hand strength tests (grip, palmar pinch, and lateral pinch) and 2 dexterity tests (the Box and Block test [BBT] and the Nine Hole Peg test [NHPT]) in patients with stroke. Methods. The 5 tests were administered on 62 stroke patients in 2 sessions, 3 to 7 days apart. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine the level of reproducibility between measurements on 2 sessions. The SRD was used to determine the extent of measurement error because of chance variation in individual patients. SRD percentage (SRD relative to mean score) was used to compare test-retest reliability across tests. We analyzed the group as a whole, then in 2 subgroups (hand spasticity vs none). Results. The test-retest reproducibility of all 5 tests was high for all the patients, with ICCs ranging from 0.85 to 0.98. The SRDs for the more/less affected hand were: 2.9/4.7 kg for the grip test; 1.2/1.3 kg for the palmar pinch test; 1.4/1.0 kg for the lateral pinch test; 5.5/7.8 blocks/minute for the BBT; and 32.8/6.2 seconds for the NHPT. Unacceptably high SRD percentages (>30%) were found for the affected hand using the NHPT (54%), palmar pinch (35%), and lateral pinch (34%). When comparing these indices for participants with spasticity versus none for all 5 tests, the ICCs were lower and the SRD and SRD percentage were higher for the spasticity group. Conclusions. All 5 tests demonstrated satisfactory test-retest reproducibility for a diverse group of patients with stroke. However, all tests showed higher levels of measurement error when performed with the more affected hand and in patients with hypertonicity of that hand. Thus, baseline and postrehabilitation change scores using these common tests of strength and dexterity must be interpreted with some caution, especially in poorly controlled clinical trials. Repeated measures ought to be incorporated to examine reliability within a trial that includes participants with a hypertonic hand.},

The results show that the test-retest reliability is good (intra-class correlation coefficients from 0·66 to 0·90, depending on the subtest).

Design: Multicentre cohort study. Setting: Three European referral centres for neurorehabilitation. Subjects: Thirty-seven stroke, 14 multiple sclerosis and five traumatic brain injury patients. Main measures: Scores of the Fugl-Meyer Test (arm section), Action Research Arm Test, and Box and Block Test derived from video information. Results: All three motor tests showed very high inter-rater and test-retest reliability (ICC and rho for main variables > 0.95). Correlation between the motor scales was very high (rho > 0.92). Motor scales correlated moderately highly with the Hemispheric Stroke Scale, a measure of impairment (rho = 0.660-0.689), but not with the Modified Barthel Index, a measure of the ability to cope with basic activities of daily living (rho = 0.044-0.086). Conclusions: The standardized guidelines assured comparability of test administration and scoring across clinical facilities. The arm motor scales provided information that was not identical to information from the Hemispheric Stroke Scale or the Modified Barthel Index. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.},

The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of the Box and Block (B&B) Test of Manual Dexterity for upper-extremity function in patients with fibromyalgia and to compare their results with those of healthy control participants. METHOD. We assessed reliability of the B&B Test within and between testers using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We compared fibromyalgia patient (n=30) and control group (n=30) scores using analysis of variance and population-based normative data. RESULTS. The B&B Test was reliable with ICCs of.90 to.85. Fibromyalgia patients' B&B Test scores were significantly lower (more impaired) than those of the control group and standardized norms. CONCLUSIONS. The B&B Test is a reliable measure of upper-extremity function in fibromyalgia patients and is able to reveal a reduction in upper-extremity function in these patients compared with both healthy control participants and normative scores.},

   abstract = {Arm movement kinematics may provide a more sensitive way to assess neurorehabilitation outcomes than existing metrics. However, measuring arm kinematics in people with stroke can be challenging for traditional optical tracking systems due to non-ideal environments, expense, and difficulty performing required calibration. Here, we present two open-source methods, one using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and another using virtual reality (Vive) sensors, for accurate measurements of wrist position with respect to the shoulder during reaching movements in people with stroke. We assessed the accuracy of each method during a 3D reaching task. We also demonstrated each method’s ability to track two metrics derived from kinematics-sweep area and smoothness-in people with chronic stroke. We computed correlation coefficients between the kinematics estimated by each method when appropriate. Compared to a traditional optical tracking system, both methods accurately tracked the wrist during reaching, with mean signed errors of 0.09 ± 1.81 cm and 0.48 ± 1.58 cm for the IMUs and Vive, respectively. Furthermore, both methods’ estimated kinematics were highly correlated with each other (p < 0.01). By using relatively inexpensive wearable sensors, these methods may be useful for developing kinematic metrics to evaluate stroke rehabilitation outcomes in both laboratory and clinical environments.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE To encourage increased participation in physical activity among Americans of all ages by issuing a public health recommendation on the types and amounts of physical activity needed for health promotion and disease prevention. PARTICIPANTS A planning committee of five scientists was established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine to organize a workshop. This committee selected 15 other workshop discussants on the basis of their research expertise in issues related to the health implications of physical activity. Several relevant professional or scientific organizations and federal agencies also were represented. EVIDENCE The panel of experts reviewed the pertinent physiological, epidemiologic, and clinical evidence, including primary research articles and recent review articles. CONSENSUS PROCESS Major issues related to physical activity and health were outlined, and selected members of the expert panel drafted sections of the paper from this outline. A draft manuscript was prepared by the planning committee and circulated to the full panel in advance of the 2-day workshop. During the workshop, each section of the manuscript was reviewed by the expert panel. Primary attention was given to achieving group consensus concerning the recommended types and amounts of physical activity. A concise "public health message" was developed to express the recommendations of the panel. During the ensuing months, the consensus statement was further reviewed and revised and was formally endorsed by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine. CONCLUSION Every US adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days of the week.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with restricted physical capacity, limited quality of life, and a poor prognosis because of right heart failure. The present study is the first prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of exercise and respiratory training in patients with severe symptomatic PH. METHODS AND RESULTS - Thirty patients with PH (21 women; mean age, 50±13 years; mean pulmonary artery pressure, 50±15 mm Hg; mean World Health Organization [WHO] class, 2.9±0.5; pulmonary arterial hypertension, n=23; chronic thromboembolic PH, n=7) on stable disease-targeted medication were randomly assigned to a control (n=15) and a primary training (n=15) group. Medication remained unchanged during the study period. Primary end points were the changes from baseline to week 15 in the distance walked in 6 minutes and in scores of the Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life questionnaire. Changes in WHO functional class, Borg scale, and parameters of echocardiography and gas exchange also were assessed. At week 15, patients in the primary and secondary training groups had an improved 6-minute walking distance; the mean difference between the control and the primary training group was 111 m (95% confidence interval, 65 to 139 m; P<0.001). Exercise training was well tolerated and improved scores of quality of life, WHO functional class, peak oxygen consumption, oxygen consumption at the anaerobic threshold, and achieved workload. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure values at rest did not change significantly after 15 weeks of exercise and respiratory training (from 61±18 to 54±18 mm Hg) within the training group. CONCLUSIONS - This study indicates that respiratory and physical training could be a promising adjunct to medical treatment in severe PH. The effects add to the beneficial results of modern medical treatment. © 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Substantial evidence also indicates that acute and chronic inflammation is involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and major cardiovascular events. The most commonly utilized marker of inflammation is C-reactive protein (CRP). In this review, we discuss the importance of inflammation, especially CRP, as a cardiovascular risk marker by reviewing an abundant cross-sectional and clinical intervention literature providing evidence that physical activity, enhanced fitness, and ET are inversely associated with CRP and that being overweight or obese is directly related with inflammation/CRP. Although we discuss the controversy regarding whether or not ET reduces CRP independent of weight loss, clearly physical activity, improved fitness, and ET are associated with reductions in inflammation and overall cardiovascular risk in both primary and secondary prevention.

The 2 main types of PROMs include generic (general health) PROMs, which provide a measure of general health for any health state, and specific PROMs, which focus on specific symptoms, diseases, organs, body regions, or body functions. The establishment of a PROM instrument requires the fulfillment of methodological standards and rigorous testing to ensure that it is valid, reliable, responsive, and acceptable to the intended population. A survey of the 41 ISAR member registries showed that 8 registries administered a PROMs program that covered all elective hip or knee arthroplasty patients and 6 registries collected PROMs for sample populations; 1 other registry had planned but had not started collection of PROMs. The most common generic instruments used were the EuroQol 5 dimension health outcome survey (EQ-5D) and the Short Form 12 health survey (SF-12) or the similar Veterans RAND 12-item health survey (VR-12). The most common specific PROMs were the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Oxford Hip Score (OHS), the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and the University of California at Los Angeles Activity Score (UCLA).},

The 2 generic PROMs in common use are the Short Form health surveys (SF-36 or SF-12) and EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ-5D). The Working Group recommends that registries should choose specific PROMs that have been appropriately developed with good measurement properties for arthroplasty patients. The Working Group recommend the use of a 1-item pain question (“During the past 4 weeks, how would you describe the pain you usually have in your [right/left] [hip/knee]?”; response: none, very mild, mild, moderate, or severe) and a single-item satisfaction outcome (“How satisfied are you with your [right/left] [hip/knee] replacement?”; response: very unsatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, or very satisfied). Survey logistics include patient instructions, paper- and electronic-based data collection, reminders for follow-up, centralized as opposed to hospital-based follow-up, sample size, patient- or joint-specific evaluation, collection intervals, frequency of response, missing values, and factors in establishing a PROMs registry program. The Working Group recommends including age, sex, diagnosis at joint, general health status preoperatively, and joint pain and function score in case-mix adjustment models. Interpretation and statistical analysis should consider the absolute level of pain, function, and general health status as well as improvement, missing data, approaches to analysis and case-mix adjustment, minimal clinically important difference, and minimal detectable change. The Working Group recommends data collection immediately before and 1 year after surgery, a threshold of 60% for acceptable frequency of response, documentation of non-responders, and documentation of incomplete or missing data.},

After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, work status, smoking status, cotinine concentration, hypertension, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and aspirin use, the odds ratios for elevated C-reactive protein concentration (dichotomized at the ≥85th percentile of the sex-specific distribution) were 0.98 (95% confidence interval = 0.78-1.23), 0.85 (0.70-1.02), and 0.53 (0.40-0.71) for participants who engaged in light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, respectively, during the previous month compared with participants who did not engage in any leisure-time physical activity. In addition, leisure-time physical activity was positively associated with serum albumin concentration and inversely associated with both log-transformed plasma fibrinogen concentration and log-transformed white blood cell count. Conclusions. These results add to mounting evidence that physical activity may reduce inflammation, which is a critical process in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {The cardiac benefits of exercise have been recognized for centuries. Studies have undisputedly shown that regular exercise is beneficial for the cardiovascular system in young, old, healthy and diseased populations. For these reasons, physical activity has been recommended worldwide for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment. Although the benefits of exercise are clear, understanding of the molecular triggers that orchestrate these effects remains incomplete and has been a topic of intense research in recent years. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the cardiac effects of physical activity, beginning with a brief history of exercise in cardiovascular medicine and then discussing seminal work on the physiological effects of exercise in healthy, diseased and aged hearts. Later, we revisit pioneering work on the molecular mechanisms underlying the cardiac benefits of exercise, and we conclude with our view on the translational potential of this knowledge as a powerful platform for cardiovascular disease drug discovery.

   abstract = {It was at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Pasadena in 2008 when, over a beer, we decided to write an undergraduate textbook on robotics. Since 1996, Frank had been teaching robot kinematics to Seoul National University undergraduates using his own lecture notes; by 2008 these notes had evolved to the kernel around which this book was written. Kevin had been teaching his introductory robotics class at Northwestern University from his own set of notes, with content drawn from an eclectic collection of papers and books. We believe that there is a distinct and unifying perspective to mechanics, planning, and control for robots that is lost if these subjects are studied inde- pendently, or as part of other more traditional subjects. At the 2008 meeting, we noted the lack of a textbook that (a) treated these topics in a unified way, with plenty of exercises and figures, and (b), most importantly, was written at a level appropriate for a first robotics course for undergraduates with only freshman-level physics, ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, and a lit- tle bit of computing background. We decided that the only sensible recourse was to write such a book ourselves. (We didn’t know then that it would take us more than eight years to finish the project!) A second motivation for this book, and one that we believe sets it apart from other introductory treatments on robotics, is its emphasis on modern geometric techniques. Often the most salient physical features of a robot are best captured by a geometric description. The advantages of the geometric approach have been recognized for quite some time by practitioners of classical screw theory. What has made these tools largely inaccessible to undergraduates—the primary tar- get audience for this book—is that they require an entirely new language of notations and constructs (screws, twists, wrenches, reciprocity, transversality, conjugacy, etc.), and their often obscure rules for manipulation and transfor- mation. On the other hand, the mostly algebraic alternatives to screw theory often mean that students end up buried in the details of calculation, losing th},

Especially, the extended state observer (ESO) is designed to estimate not only the UDMU but also the unmeasured velocities of FMWMP. Based on the designed ESO, a sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is utilised to ensure the tracking performance as expected. By using Lyapunov synthesis, it is shown that all the signals of the whole system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, simulations and experiments are carried out with two different kinds of reference trajectories. Furthermore, a comparative work is done to show that the ESO-SMC controller has better control performance than traditional proportional–integral–derivative controller.},

Motion simulations of a single four-Mecanum-wheeled virtual robot prototype on RecurDyn and motion tests of a robot physical prototype are carried out, and the motions of a variety of combined mobile configurations are also simulated. Motion simulation and test results prove that the kinematic models of single-and multiple-robot combination systems are correct, and the inverse kinematic correction model with velocity compensation matrix is feasible. Through simulations or experiments, the velocity compensation coefficients of the robots can be measured and the velocity compensation matrix can be created. This modified inverse kinematic model can effectively reduce the errors of robot motion caused by wheel slippage and improve the motion accuracy of the mobile robot system.},

Methods - We evaluated hospitalized stroke events reported in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study to describe the clinical characteristics of incident stroke. Confirmed stroke cases (n=474) were evaluated for stroke symptoms (headache, vertigo, gait disturbance, convulsions) and stroke signs (hemianopia, diplopia, speech deficits, paresis, paresthesia/sensory deficits) and their univariate associations with race, sex, and stroke subtype. Results - Over 9.2 years of follow-up, 402 (85%) ischemic and 72 (15%) hemorrhagic strokes occurred. Frequency of stroke symptoms (95% CIs) were as follows: headache (27.4%; 23.4% to 31.4%), gait disturbance (10.8%; 7.9% to 13.6%), convulsions (4.4%; 2.6% to 6.3%), and vertigo (2.1%; 0.8% to 3.4%). Speech deficits occurred in 24.0% (20.2% to 27.9%), hemianopia in 14.6% (11.4% to 17.7%), and diplopia in 5.5% (3.4% to 7.5%) of cases. Most cases involved paresis (81.6%; 78.1% to 85.1%), while fewer cases experienced sensory deficits (44.5%; 40.0% to 49.0%). Blacks were more likely than whites to experience paresis (85.4% versus 78.2%; P=0.044). Men were more likely than women to experience a gait disturbance (14.4% versus 6.7%; P=0.007). Persons with hemorrhagic strokes had a higher proportion of headaches (55.6% versus 22.4%; P=0.001) and convulsions (11.1% versus 3.2%; P=0.003) than those with ischemic events, while speech and sensory deficits were more common in ischemic strokes (26.1% versus 12.5%, P=0.013, and 49.0% versus 19.4%, P=0.001, respectively). Conclusions - We present epidemiological data concerning the clinical characteristics of incident stroke in a population-based cohort. Although minor differences by race, sex, and stroke subtype were observed, data from additional follow-up are required to confirm observed variations.},

The relationship between impaired precision and force in voluntary movement (hemiparesis) and the increment in muscle tone that stems from dysregulated activity of the stretch reflex (spasticity) is far from clear. Here we aimed to elucidate whether variation in lesion topography affects hemiparesis and spasticity in a similar or dis-similar manner. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was used to assess the impact of lesion topography on (a) upper limb paresis, as reflected by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale for the upper limb and (b) elbow flexor spasticity, as reflected by the Tonic Stretch Reflex Threshold, in 41 patients with first-ever stroke. Hemiparesis and spasticity were affected by damage to peri-Sylvian cortical and subcortical regions and the putamen. Hemiparesis (but not spasticity) was affected by damage to the corticospinal tract at corona-radiata and capsular levels, and by damage to white-matter association tracts and additional regions in the temporal cortex and pallidum. VLSM conjunction analysis showed only a minor overlap of brain voxels where the existence of damage affected both hemiparesis and spasticity, suggesting that control of voluntary movement and regulation of muscle tone at rest involve largely separate parts of the motor network.},

The first mode consisted of the movement in the left-right direction, the second mode was the movement in the forward-backward direction, the third mode moved in the circular direction, and the fourth mode moved in number 8-shapaed direction (clockwise and counterclockwise).The developed skateboard could adjust the speed of the movement of three levels including LOW, MEDIUM and HIGH to meet the patients' needs. The number of physical therapy sessions can also be set as needed. There was also an LCD display for ease of use. It could be concluded that skateboard could properly rehabilitate arm movement at the desired direction and speed. The skateboard could be able to meet the basic needs of the weak arm exercise. Moreover, there was also a display making it easy for users to quickly access information, reducing the duration of patient treatment.

The appearance of markers and the detection robustness are generally limited by the existing detection algorithms, which are hand-crafted with traditional low-level image processing techniques. Furthermore, a sophisticatedly designed coding system is required to overcome the shortcomings of both markers and detection algorithms. To improve the flexibility and robustness in various applications, we propose a general deep learning based framework, DeepTag, for fiducial marker design and detection. DeepTag not only supports detection of a wide variety of existing marker families, but also makes it possible to design new marker families with customized local patterns. Moreover, we propose an effective procedure to synthesize training data on the fly without manual annotations. Thus, DeepTag can easily adapt to existing and newly-designed marker families. To validate DeepTag and existing methods, beside existing datasets, we further collect a new large and challenging dataset where markers are placed in different view distances and angles. Experiments show that DeepTag well supports different marker families and greatly outperforms the existing methods in terms of both detection robustness and pose accuracy.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Peak grip force and temporal coupling between the grip force and lift-off of the object. RESULTS All subjects were able to better regulate grip force when provided with additional sensory input. Light finger touch resulted in decreased grip force, as did skateboard use ( P <.05). Subjects with hemiparesis showed 2 times longer latency between grip-force application and lift-off of the object ( P <.05).

   abstract = {<p>Researchers have identified several of the cellular events associated with wound healing. Platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, and fibroblasts primarily contribute to the process. They release cytokines including interleukins (ILs) and TNF-α, and growth factors, of which platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is perhaps the most important. The cytokines and growth factors manipulate the inflammatory phase of healing. Cytokines are chemotactic for white cells and fibroblasts, while the growth factors initiate fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. Inflammation is followed by the proliferation of fibroblasts, which lay down the extracellular matrix. Simultaneously, various white cells and other connective tissue cells release both the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of these metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs remove damaged structural proteins such as collagen, while the fibroblasts lay down fresh extracellular matrix proteins. Fluid collected from acute, healing wounds contains growth factors, and stimulates fibroblast proliferation, but fluid collected from chronic, nonhealing wounds does not. Fibroblasts from chronic wounds do not respond to chronic wound fluid, probably because the fibroblasts of these wounds have lost the receptors that respond to cytokines and growth factors. Nonhealing wounds contain high levels of IL1, IL6, and MMPs, and an abnormally high MMP/TIMP ratio. Clinical examination of wounds inconsistently predicts which wounds will heal when procedures like secondary closure are planned. Surgeons therefore hope that these chemicals can be used as biomarkers of wounds which have impaired ability to heal. There is also evidence that the application of growth factors like PDGF will help the healing of chronic, nonhealing wounds.</p>},

However, the drug activity has strict requirements on processing temperature and preparation method of filaments, the implant also has strict biocompatibility requirements for the materials. In this study, a drug delivery implant was prepared with good biocompatibility, controlled and efficient drug release using FDM printing for personalized administration. Drug-loaded filaments were developed for FDM process by hot-melt extrusion (HME). Polycaprolactone was used as a drug delivery carrier, and ibuprofen as the model drug. Notably, chitosan was dissolved to form controlled and efficient release channels. The printability, changes in physical and chemical properties during HME and FDM processes of the filament, and drug release behavior, mechanism and biocompatibility of the implants were investigated. The results showed that the filament tensile strength decreased with the increase of drug and chitosan content. No obvious degradation and chemical change occurred during the whole process. The drug release efficiency could reach>99% and lasted for 120 h mainly via the diffusion - erosion mechanism. The viability of cells cultured for 24 h in 72 h, 100% implant extract was 75.3%.},

   abstract = {Optimal recovery of arm function following stroke requires patients to perform a large number of functional arm movements in clinical therapy sessions, as well as at home. Technology to monitor adherence to this activity would be helpful to patients and clinicians. Current approaches to monitoring arm movements are limited because of challenges in distinguishing between functional and non-functional movements. Here, we present an Arm Rehabilitation Monitor (ARM), a device intended to make such measurements in an unobtrusive manner. The ARM device is based on a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) worn on the wrist and uses machine learning techniques to interpret the resulting signals. We characterized the ability of the ARM to detect reaching actions in a functional assessment dataset (functional assessment tasks) and an Activities-of-Daily-Living (ADL) dataset (pizza-making and walking task) from 12 participants with stroke. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers had a Matthews Correlation Coefficient score of 0.59 and 0.58 when trained and tested on the functional dataset, 0.50 and 0.49 when trained and tested on the ADL dataset, and 0.37 and 0.36 when trained on the functional dataset and tested on the ADL dataset, respectively. The latter is the most relevant scenario for the intended application of training during a clinical visit for monitoring movements in the in-home setting. The classifiers showed good performance in estimating the time spent reaching and number of reaching gestures and showed low sensitivity to irrelevant arm movements produced during walking. We conclude that the ARM has sufficient accuracy and robustness to merit being used in preliminary studies to monitor arm activity in rehabilitation or home applications.},

   abstract = {The amount of stress imposed on shoulder and elbow appears to be directly correlated with the degree of maximum shoulder external rotation (MER) during throwing motions. Therefore, identifying risk factors contributing to the increase of MER angle may help to decrease the throwing injuries occurrence in baseball players. The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the correlation between MER and the kinematic variables at stride foot contact (SFC) during the early cocking phase, the passive range of motion (ROM), and the shoulder strength. The subjects were 40 high school baseball players. Each subject carried out five throwing tasks with his maximum effort. A three-dimensional analysis was performed to obtain the MER, and the shoulder angles of external rotation (ER), extension and abduction at SFC in the early cocking phase. The ROM and muscle strength of the shoulder ER and internal rotation (IR) were also measured. Significant moderate linear correlations were found between the MER and the ER (r =-0.32, p = 0.04) at SFC, extension angle (r= 0.35, p = 0.03) at SFC, IR strength (r =-0.30, p = 0.04) and passive ROM of ER (r = 0.46, p = 0.01). The shoulder IR and extension angles at SFC may determine the degree of the MER angle. Furthermore, weak IR muscle strength and excessive ROM of ER might be risk factors for shoulder and elbow injuries. The finding will enable us to establish better prevention and rehabilitation strategies for throwing injuries in baseball players.},

Three main contributions are presented. First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Tracing and extracting contour pixels are widely used for smart/wearable image sensor devices, because these are simple and useful for detecting objects. In this paper, we present a novel contour-tracing algorithm for fast and accurate contour following. The proposed algorithm classifies the type of contour pixel, based on its local pattern. Then, it traces the next contour using the previous pixel's type. Therefore, it can classify the type of contour pixels as a straight line, inner corner, outer corner and inner-outer corner, and it can extract pixels of a specific contour type. Moreover, it can trace contour pixels rapidly because it can determine the local minimal path using the contour case. In addition, the proposed algorithm is capable of the compressing data of contour pixels using the representative points and inner-outer corner points, and it can accurately restore the contour image from the data. To compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to that of conventional techniques, we measure their processing time and accuracy. In the experimental results, the proposed algorithm shows better performance compared to the others. Furthermore, it can provide the compressed data of contour pixels and restore them accurately, including the inner-outer corner, which cannot be restored using conventional algorithms.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate weight loss in patients with SCCHN undergoing two different radiotherapy (RT) schedules. Material and methods. Nutritional data were analyzed from the ARTSCAN study, a controlled randomized prospective Swedish multicenter study conducted with the aim of comparing conventional fractionation (2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 7 weeks) and accelerated fractionation (1.1 + 2.0 Gy per day, total 68 Gy during 4.5 weeks). Seven hundred and fifty patients were randomized and 712 patients were followed from the start of RT in the present nutritional study. Results. The patients had a weight loss of 11.3% (± 8.6%) during the acute phase (start of RT up to five months after the termination of RT). No difference in weight loss was seen between the two RT fractionation schedules (p = 0.839). Three factors were significantly predictive for weight loss during the acute phase, i.e. tumor site, overweight/obesity or lack of tube feeding at the start of RT. Moreover, the nadir point of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of RT. Conclusion. The results of the present study showed no difference in weight loss between the two RT fractionation schedules and also highlight that weight loss in SCCHN is a multifactorial problem. Moreover, the nadir of weight loss occurred at five months after the termination of treatment which calls for more intense nutritional interventions during the period after treatment. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.},

This study aimed to identify the reliable predictors of severe weight loss during three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in head and neck cancer patients. Weight changes during radiotherapy were investigated on 87 patients. Tumor site, T-stage, BMI, age, smoking, treatment modality, and prior surgery were considered as effective factors. During the 3D-CRT, 78.7% of patients experienced weight loss (p<0.001). The risk of weight loss was higher in patients with cancer in the larynx and oral cavity. Severe weight loss (≥5% during the radiation course) was observed in 47.8% of patients. There was the highest risk of severe weight loss in patients undergoing chemoradiation therapy with previous surgical resection (83.3%). The incidence of severe weight loss in normal-weight patients compared to overweight patients was significant. Severe weight loss was more common at higher doses and in younger patients. BMI regardless of body composition is not a credible predictor. Advanced tumor stage and combined treatment modality in head and neck cancer patients which result in synergizing of treatment toxicities, can be used as the reliable risk factors of severe weight loss during radiotherapy.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Many patients with head-and-neck (H&N) cancer have tumor shrinkage and/or weight loss during the course of radiotherapy. We conducted this retrospective study to determine the dosimetric effects of repeat computed tomography (CT) imaging and replanning during the course of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on both normal tissues and target volumes. Methods and Materials: A retrospective chart review identified 13 patients with H&N cancer treated with IMRT who had repeat CT imaging and replanning during the course of radiotherapy. The first IMRT plan for each patient was generated based on the original planning CT scan acquired before the start of treatment. Because of tumor shrinkage or weight loss during radiotherapy, a second CT scan was acquired, and a new plan was generated and used to complete the course of IMRT. CT-CT fusion was used to correct patient positioning differences between the scans. By using a commercial inverse IMRT planning system, a hybrid IMRT plan was generated for each patient by applying the beam configurations of the first IMRT plan (including the intensity profile of each beam) to the anatomy of the second CT scan. The dose-volume histograms of the actual and hybrid IMRT plans were compared using analysis of variance methods for repeated measures. Results: All patients had locally advanced, nonmetastatic Stage III or IV disease, including 6 nasopharynx, 6 oropharynx, and 1 unknown primary site. All patients were treated with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. When replanning vs. not replanning was compared, the hybrid IMRT plans (without replanning) demonstrated reduced doses to target volumes and increased doses to critical structures. The doses to 95% (D95) of the planning target volumes of the gross tumor volume (PTVGTV) and the clinical target volume (PTVCTV) were reduced in 92% of patients, by 0.8-6.3 Gy (p = 0.02) and 0.2-7.4 Gy (p = 0.003), respectively. The maximum dose (D max) to the spinal cord increased in all patients (range, 0.2-15.4 Gy; p = 0.003) and the brainstem Dmax increased in 85% of patients without replanning (range, 0.6-8.1 Gy; p = 0.007). Conclusions: Repeat CT imaging and replanning during the course of IMRT for selected patients with H&N cancer is essential to identify dosimetric changes and to ensure adequate doses to target volumes and safe doses to normal tissues. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes will help to determine criteria for repeat CT imaging and IMRT replanning for H&N cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Interfractional anatomical alterations may have a differential effect on the dose delivered by step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The increased degrees of freedom afforded by rotational delivery may increase plan robustness (measured by change in target volume coverage and doses to organs at risk [OARs]). However, this has not been evaluated for head and neck cancer. Materials and methods: A total of 10 patients who required repeat computed tomography (CT) simulation and replanning during head and neck IMRT were included. Step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT plans were generated from the original planning scan. The initial and second CT simulation scans were fused and targets/OAR contours transferred, reviewed, and modified. The plans were applied to the second CT scan and doses recalculated without repeat optimization. Differences between step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT for change in target volume coverage and doses to OARs between first and second CT scans were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: There were clinically relevant dosimetric changes between the first and the second CT scans for both the techniques (reduction in mean D95% for PTV2 and PTV3, Dmin for CTV2 and CTV3, and increased mean doses to the parotid glands). However, there were no significant differences between step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT for change in any target coverage parameter (including D95% for PTV2 and PTV3 and Dmin for CTV2 and CTV3) or dose to any OARs (including parotid glands) between the first and the second CT scans. Conclusions: For patients with head and neck cancer who required replanning mainly due to weight loss, there were no significant differences in plan robustness between step-and-shoot IMRT and VMAT. This information is useful with increased clinical adoption of VMAT.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To quantify the target and normal structures on dose distributing variations during intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to assess the value of replanning for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Methods and Materials: Twenty-eight NPC patients treated with IMRT were recruited. The IMRT was delivered in 33 fractions, to 70 to 76Gy, to the gross tumor volume (GTV). Before the 25th fraction of IMRT, a new simulation computed tomography (CT) scan was acquired for all patients. According to the dose constraint criterion in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0225 protocol, the replanning was generated on the new simulation CT. With the Quality Assessment Center of a CORVUS 6.3 treatment planning system, a phantom plan was generated for each patient by applying the beam configurations of the initial plan to the anatomy of the new simulation CT. The dose-volume histograms of the phantom plan were compared with the replanning. Results: The percentage of prescription dose delivered to the clinical target volume (CTV1) was significantly increased by 4.91% ± 10.89%, whereas the maximum dose to the spinal cord, mean dose to the left parotid, and V30 to the right parotid were significantly decreased by 5.00 ± 9.23Gy, 4.23 ± 10.03Gy, and 11.47% ± 18.89% respectively in the replanning, compared with the phantom plan (p < 0.05). Based on the dose constraint criterion in the RTOG0225 protocol, 50% of phantom plans (14/28) were out of limit for the dose to the normal critical structures, whereas no plan was out of limit in replanning (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Replanning for patients with NPC before the 25th fraction during IMRT helps to ensure adequate dose to the target volumes and safe doses to critical normal structures. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Background: Acquired brain injury (ABI) is the main cause of death and disability among young adults. In most cases, survivors can experience balance instability, resulting in functional impairments that are associated with diminished health-related quality of life. Traditional rehabilitation therapy may be tedious. This can reduce motivation and adherence to the treatment and thus provide a limited benefit to patients with balance disorders. We present eBaViR (easy Balance Virtual Rehabilitation), a system based on the Nintendo® Wii Balance Board® (WBB), which has been designed by clinical therapists to improve standing balance in patients with ABI through motivational and adaptative exercises. We hypothesize that eBaViR, is feasible, safe and potentially effective in enhancing standing balance. Methods. In this contribution, we present a randomized and controlled single blinded study to assess the influence of a WBB-based virtual rehabilitation system on balance rehabilitation with ABI hemiparetic patients. This study describes the eBaViR system and evaluates its effectiveness considering 20 one-hour-sessions of virtual reality rehabilitation (n = 9) versus standard rehabilitation (n = 8). Effectiveness was evaluated by means of traditional static and dynamic balance scales. Results: The final sample consisted of 11 men and 6 women. Mean ±SD age was 47.3 ± 17.8 and mean SD chronicity was 570.9 ± 313.2 days. Patients using eBaViR had a significant improvement in static balance (p = 0.011 in Berg Balance Scale and p = 0.011 in Anterior Reaches Test) compared to patients who underwent traditional therapy. Regarding dynamic balance, the results showed significant improvement over time in all these measures, but no significant group effect or group-by-time interaction was detected for any of them, which suggests that both groups improved in the same way. There were no serious adverse events during treatment in either group. Conclusions: The results suggest that eBaViR represents a safe and effective alternative to traditional treatment to improve static balance in the ABI population. These results have encouraged us to reinforce the virtual treatment with new exercises, so an evolution of the system is currently being developed. © 2011 Gil-Gómez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) provides a unique medium suited to the achievement of several requirements for effective rehabilitation intervention. Specifically, therapy can be provided within a functional, purposeful and motivating context. Many VR applications present opportunities for individuals to participate in experiences, which are engaging and rewarding. In addition to the value of the rehabilitation experience for the user, both therapists and users benefit from the ability to readily grade and document the therapeutic intervention using various systems. In VR, advanced technologies are used to produce simulated, interactive and multi-dimensional environments. Visual interfaces including desktop monitors and head-mounted displays (HMDs), haptic interfaces, and real-time motion tracking devices are used to create environments allowing users to interact with images and virtual objects in real-time through multiple sensory modalities. Opportunities for object manipulation and body movement through virtual space provide frameworks that, in varying degrees, are perceived as comparable to similar opportunities in the real world. This paper reviews current work on motor rehabilitation using virtual environments and virtual reality and where possible, compares outcomes with those achieved in real-world applications. © 2004 Sveistrup; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose - Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important index of outcome after stroke and may facilitate a broader description of stroke recovery. This study examined the relationship of individual and clinical characteristics to HRQOL in stroke survivors with mild to moderate stroke during subacute recovery. Methods - Two hundred twenty-nine participants 3 to 9 months poststroke were enrolled in a national multisite clinical trial (Extremity Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation). HRQOL was assessed using the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Version 3.0. The Wolf Motor Function Test documented functional recovery of the hemiplegic upper extremity. Multiple analysis of variance and regression models examined the influence of demographic and clinical variables across SIS domains. Results - Age, gender, education level, stroke type, concordance (paretic arm=dominant hand), upper extremity motor function (Wolf Motor Function Test), and comorbidities were associated across SIS domains. Poorer HRQOL in the physical domain was associated with age, nonwhite race, more comorbidities, and reduced upper-extremity function. Stroke survivors with more comorbidities reported poorer HRQOL in the area of memory and thinking, and those with an ischemic stroke and concordance reported poorer communication. Conclusions - Although results may not generalize to lower functioning stroke survivors, individual characteristics of persons with mild to moderate stroke may be important to consider in developing comprehensive, targeted interventions designed to maximize recovery and improve HRQOL. © 2005 American Heart Association, Inc.},

   abstract = {A simple and efficient bottom-roller axle intersections approach for judging the omnidirectional mobility of the Mecanum wheel configuration is proposed and proved theoretically. Based on this approach, a sub-configuration judgment method is derived. Using these methods, on the basis of analyzing the possible configurations of three and four Mecanum wheels and existing Mecanum wheel configurations of robots in practical applications, the law determining wheel configuration is elucidated. Then, the topological design methods of the Mecanum wheel configurations are summarized and refined, including the basic configuration array method, multiple wheels replacement method, and combination method. The first two methods can be used to create suitable multiple-Mecanum-wheel configurations for a single mobile robot based on the basic Mecanum wheel configuration. Multiple single robots can be arranged by combination methods including end-to-end connection, side-by-side connection, symmetrical rectangular connection, and distributed combination, and then, the abundant combination configurations of robots can be obtained. Examples of Mecanum wheel configurations design based on a symmetrical four-Mecanum-wheel configuration and three centripetal configurations using these topological design methods are presented. This work can provide methods and a reference for Mecanum wheel configurations design.},

   abstract = {Four-dimensional (4D) methods strive to achieve highly conformal radiotherapy, particularly for lung and breast tumours, in the presence of respiratory-induced motion of tumours and normal tissues. Four-dimensional radiotherapy accounts for respiratory motion during imaging, planning and radiation delivery, and requires a 4D CT image in which the internal anatomy motion as a function of the respiratory cycle can be quantified. The aims of our research were (a) to develop a method to acquire 4D CT images from a spiral CT scan using an external respiratory signal and (b) to examine the potential utility of 4D CT imaging. A commercially available respiratory motion monitoring system provided an 'external' tracking signal of the patient's breathing. Simultaneous recording of a TTL 'X-Ray ON' signal from the CT scanner indicated the start time of CT image acquisition, thus facilitating time stamping of all subsequent images. An over-sampled spiral CT scan was acquired using a pitch of 0.5 and scanner rotation time of 1.5 s. Each image from such a scan was sorted into an image bin that corresponded with the phase of the respiratory cycle in which the image was acquired. The complete set of such image bins accumulated over a respiratory cycle constitutes a 4D CT dataset. Four-dimensional CT datasets of a mechanical oscillator phantom and a patient undergoing lung radiotherapy were acquired. Motion artefacts were significantly reduced in the images in the 4D CT dataset compared to the three-dimensional (3D) images, for which respiratory motion was not accounted. Accounting for respiratory motion using 4D CT imaging is feasible and yields images with less distortion than 3D images. 4D images also contain respiratory motion information not available in a 3D CT image.},

The EKF algorithm is more realistic in non-linear systems, which has an autonomous white noise in both the system and the estimation model. Also, in the field of engineering, most systems are non-linear. Therefore, the EKF attracts more attention than the Kalman Filter (KF). In this paper, we propose an EKF-based localization algorithm by edge computing, and a mobile robot is used to update its location concerning the landmark. This localization algorithm aims to achieve a high level of accuracy and wider coverage. The proposed algorithm is helpful for the research related to the use of EKF localization algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the situations presented in the paper, the proposed localization algorithm is more accurate compared with the current state-of-the-art localization algorithms.},

   abstract = {To achieve Industry 4.0 solutions for the networking of mechatronic components in production plants, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology is the optimal way for goods transportation in the cyber-physical system (CPS). As a result, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are networked to all other participants in the production system to accept and execute transport jobs. Accurately tracking the planned paths of AGVs is therefore essential. The omnidirectional mobile vehicle has shown its excellent characteristics in crowded environments and narrow aisle spaces. However, the slip problem of the omnidirectional mobile vehicle is more serious than that of the general wheeled mobile vehicle. This paper proposes a slip estimation and compensation control method for an omnidirectional Mecanum-wheeled automated guided vehicle (OMWAGV) and implements a control system. Based on the slip estimation and compensation control of the general wheeled mobile platform, a Microchip dsPIC30F6010A microcontroller-based system uses an MPU-9250 multi-axis accelerometer sensor to derive the longitudinal speed, transverse speed, and steering angle of the omnidirectional wheel platform. These data are then compared with those from the motor encoders. A linear regression with a recursive least squares (RLS) method is utilized to estimate real-time slip ratio variations of four driving wheels and conduct the corresponding compensation and control. As a result, the driving speeds of the four omnidirectional wheels are dynamically adjusted so that the OMWAGV can accurately follow the predetermined motion trajectory. The experimental results of diagonally moving and cross-walking motions without and with slip estimation and compensation control showed that, without calculating the errors occurred during travel, the distances between the original starting position to the stopping position are dramatically reduced from 1.52 m to 0.03 m and from 1.56 m to 0.03 m, respectively. The higher tracking accuracy of the proposed method verifies its effectiveness and validness.},

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 847. Abstract: In mirror training (MIT), stroke patients strive to move their hands while looking at the reflected image of the unaffected one. The recruitment of the mirror neurons and visual-proprioceptive conflict are expected to facilitate the paretic voluntary movement. Here, a reversed MIT (REMIT) is presented, which requires moving hands while looking at the reflected image of the paretic one, giving the illusion of being unable to move the unimpaired hand. This study compares MIT and REMIT on post-stroke upper-limb recovery to gain clues on the mechanism of action of mirror therapies. Eight chronic stroke patients underwent two weeks of MIT and REMIT (five sessions each) in a crossover design. Upper-limb Fugl-Meyer, Box and Block and handgrip strength tests were administered at baseline and treatments end. The strength of the mirror illusion was evaluated after each session. MIT induced a larger illusory effect. The Fugl-Meyer score improved to the same extent after both treatments. No changes occurred in the Box and Block and the handgrip tests. REMIT and MIT were equally effective on upper-limb dexterity, challenging the exclusive role of mirror neurons. Contrasting learned nonuse through an intersensory conflict might provide the rationale for both forms of mirror-based rehabilitation after stroke.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking’ were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history’. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.
